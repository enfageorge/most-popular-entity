""" Modi government's decision to give priority to extremely backwards castes and provide reservation benefits through sub- categorisation is a just initiative,"" BJP president Amit Shah tweeted. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also welcomed the move, saying it would expand the benefits the OBCs have reaped, indicating the political initiative behind the decision. Nine other states, including Bengal, have carried out sub- categorisation of OBCs. BJP managers said the cabinet's decision was aimed at taking Nitish's and the party's successful Uttar Pradesh strategy to the national level with an eye on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. With Nitish back in the NDA fold, they said, the party has a better chance to expand its political reach among the extremely backward castes. In his first stint as Bihar chief minister in 2005, Nitish had sub- categorised the OBCs or formed a quota within the larger OBC quota by creating two categories — backwards and extremely backwards. The idea was to make hundreds of castes from the larger OBC category break ranks with the dominant Yadavs. The move had led to Nitish carving out his own vote base known as the "" atyant pichhda "" or EBCs ( extremely backward classes) that formed over 30 per cent of Bihar's population. In Uttar Pradesh earlier this year, the BJP had fielded over 40 per cent non- Yadav OBC candidates and run a below- the- radar campaign to highlight that only two sections, the Yadavs and the Muslims, had reaped the benefits of power under the Akhilesh Yadav government. The communal angle was also used with a view to consolidate the wider Hindu vote. The strategy worked well, BJP sources said. A similar strategy was employed to isolate Dalit leader and BSP chief Mayawati by fielding a good number of non- Jatav Dalits. FROM PAGE 1 ¥"

":Seven years after advocate Shahid Azmi was gunned down by three unidentified persons inside his office at Kurla, a sessions court on Saturday framed charges against four accused in the case. The court framed charges against key accused and alleged hit man Devendra Babu Jagtap alias JD, Hasmukh Solanki, Pintoo Dagale and Vinod Vichare on charges of murder, criminal conspiracy and under provisions of the Arms Act. The move will now pave the way for the trial to commence. The four accused have pleaded not guilty . While JD and Solanki are in jail, the two others have been granted bail. The 32-year-old lawyer who defended undertrials in terror cases was killed on February 11, 2010 at the Taximen's colony in Kurla where he lived. In his brief but promising career, Azmi represented the accused in the 2611 attack, the train blasts in Mumbai, Malegaon blasts, among over 100 terror suspects. Azmi had found himself in the police net when he was just 16 and was accused of terror related charges. He spent five years in prison before he was acquitted by the Supreme Court.. The police had alleged that the contract to kill Azmi was given by the now dead don Bharat Nepali who portrayed himself as a true patriot and believed Azmi was an anti-social element. The murder was allegdly executed on the instructions of Nepali and his associate who had paid Rs one lakh to the killers. In May 2010, police filed a 1,200-page chargesheet in the case. There were 95 witnesses in the case including two eyewitnesses. Initially, the four accused in Azmi's murder were booked under provisions of the special Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA). However in 2011, the court dropped the MCOCA charges. The charges were dropped after the police failed to prove underworld links as well as the pecuniary gain in killing the advocate. An appeal was submitted against this in the Bombay high court. Azmi's brother Khaled Azmi, also an advocate, said he was relieved that chgarges had been framed. He hoped that trial would commence soon."
"1. What is portfolio concentration? Diversified equity mutual fund schemes hold stocks of a number of companies in their portfolio. Generally , such funds hold anywhere between 40-75 stocks in the portfolio. However, there are some schemes that tend to hold only 20-25 stocks in their portfolio.Such schemes are said to run concen trated portfolios. In such schemes, the top 5 to 10 holdings in the portfolio constitute more than 50% of the port folio. On the other hand, if such hold ings constitute less than 40% of the portfolio, it is called as a diffused portfolio. 2. How do concentrated portfolios work?Concentrated funds hold lower number of stocks. These equity mutual fund schemes, concentrate on the fund man ager's best ideas and take higher exposure to these stocks, with the objective of generating higher alpha. Generally , the top-10 ideas would constitute as much as 50-65% of the total portfolio. While most mutual funds hold about 40-70 stocks in their portfolios and then hold small amounts generally not exceeding 5% in each stock, concentrated funds eliminate small holdings while ensuring that the same benefits of diversification are there. Even concentrated funds cannot invest more than 10% of their portfolio in a single stock and can go up to 12% after the trustee's approval. It's not just in individual securities that portfolios can be concentrated. Funds that hold high weights to a particular sector are also concentrated. In equity funds, for example, some funds have weight as high as 40-50% to the banking and financial services space. Such funds generally hold few stocks within a concentrated sector. 3. What is their strategy? Many financial planners believe con centrated bets work well. If a fund manager identifies stocks that can perform well and gets them right, high holding in these stocks can give high returns in comparison to the category and benchmark. In comparison a portfolio with small holdings will see higher gains offset by lower gains or losses in other stocks. They believe a concentrated strategy can work well in range-bound markets, when only a few stocks rise and the rest trade within a limited range. 4. Which investors are these concentrated portfolios meant for? Equity funds with concentrated hold ings could be volatile or can suffer from periods of underperformance. If a fund manager has a large position in a stock and the call goes wrong, it could take a long time to get out of the position. In comparison funds, with a smaller holding can get out quickly.

Hry notifies holiday in P’kula Sec 2, 4, 5, 6

Govt schools in Mohali open today

Exercise caution, Kirron asks residents

With the date of judgment just two days away, about 1.5 lakh Dera Sacha Sauda followers have reached Panchkula. The followers spilled from the Naam Charcha Ghar in Sector 23 into the entire city. They have been sitting in parks, on road dividers, roadsides and along the National Highway-73. On Tuesday night, the followers slept on the road separating Sectors 3 and 21 outside Tau Devi Lal Stadium. In the morning, the passage was blocked. They had to be moved to an open site in the afternoon in Sector 3 between Holiday Inn and the golf course to clear the passage. All roads leading to the Sector 1-based District Courts complex have been sealed. Barbed wires and barricades have been put up at Majri Chowk, the Suraj theatre at old Panchkula and Bella Vista Chowk. Barbed wires of 3 to 3.5 ft have been put up. Commuters coming from Barwala and Raipur Rani were left harassed as they could not enter Panchkula via Majri Chowk. The entry through the Housing Board light point has been squeezed as due to barricades vehicles could enter or leave only in a queue. The entry to Chandigarh near the Vigilance police station in Sector 17 has also been closed. Cops were seen mounted on horses in Sector 2 today. Advocates at the District Courts suspended work for three days, beginning today. “The decision has been taken to avoid harassment to advocates. On the day of the verdict, the entry of advocates would be from the Suraj theatre side,” said Abhishek Rana, a lawyer. Deputy Commissioner Gauri Prashar Joshi had already announced the closure of all government and private educational institutions for three days — August 23 to August 25. She appealed to people and the dera followers to maintain peace in view of the August 25 order. “We have formed a peace committee and have been interacting with dera followers for the past two days,” she said. Regarding rumours of closure of petrol pumps and business establishments, she clarified that as of now only educational institutions had been closed for three days. “We can’t comment on how he will reach here,” she said when asked whether the dera chief was reaching by a helicopter. Commissioner of Police, Panchkula, AS Chawla said, “Panchkula has been allotted 25 paramilitary companies, all of which will reach by tomorrow. Besides, 2000 cops have also been deployed.” The police tested drone cameras, which will be deployed on August 25.The Chandigarh Administration has announced that all educational institutions — schools and colleges -- in Chandigarh (government, private, aided, unaided and technical) will remain closed on August 24 and 25.

"50 Million People in Pakistan Are at Risk of Arsenic Poisoning From Contaminated Groundwater

People at a filtration plant fill their bottles with water from a tube well in Islamabad, Pakistan, Aug. 23, 2017.

(ISLAMABAD) — Some 50 million people are at risk of arsenic poisoning from contaminated groundwater in Pakistan's Indus Valley — far more than previously thought, according to a new study.

Pakistan is aware of the growing problem, with arsenic levels rising in some areas as people increasingly and indiscriminately draw from the country's underground aquifers, said Lubna Bukhari, who heads the government's Council for Research in Water Resources.

""It's a real concern,"" she said. ""Because of lack of rules and regulations, people have exploited the groundwater brutally, and it is driving up arsenic levels.""

The authors of the study developed a map highlighting areas of likely contamination based on water quality data from nearly 1,200 groundwater pumps tested from 2013 to 2015, and accounting for geological factors including surface slope and soil contents. They determined some 88 million people were living in high-risk areas.

Given that about 60-70% of the population relies on groundwater, they calculated that roughly 50 million — maybe even 60 million — were potentially affected. That's equal to at least a third of the 150 million already estimated by the World Health Organization to be drinking, cooking and farming with arsenic-laced water worldwide.

""This is an alarmingly high number, which demonstrates the urgent need to test all drinking water wells in the Indus Plain,"" with hotspots around the densely populated cities of Lahore and Hyderabad, said the study's lead author, Joel Podgorski, of the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, known as Eawag.

The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances .

The high-risk area mapped out in the study broadly covers the middle and lower reaches of the Indus River and its tributaries, before they empty into the Arabian Sea.

Scientists had expected this area might be affected. Similar geographical areas along the Ganges River in neighboring India and Brahmaputra in Bangladesh also contain pockets of arsenic contamination.

Normally, that arsenic would stay in the ground. But in the last few decades, South Asian countries concerned with pathogen-infused surface water have been pumping enormous volumes of groundwater, causing the water tables to drop drastically and tapping into new water pockets tainted by the colorless, odorless toxin.

The WHO considers arsenic concentrations above 10 micrograms per liter to be dangerous. Pakistan's guideline is five times that, and many of its wells test much higher.

Arsenic is naturally occurring and kills human cells — causing skin lesions, organ damage, heart disease and cancer. There is no cure for arsenic poisoning.

""This study is important because it draws attention to an overlooked — yet solvable — problem of vast magnitude affecting the health of millions of villagers,"" said geochemist Alexander van Geen of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, who was not involved in the study. He said the patterns it identifies are broadly consistent with data he and other researchers have collected from some 10,000 well tests in the region.

One of those researchers, Abida Farooqui, assistant professor of environmental sciences at Islamabad's Qaid-e-Azam University, said the new study's sample size may be too small to draw clear conclusions.

""The study revealed very important and an emerging problem of arsenic in the country,"" Farooqui said. But ""only 1,193 samples have been used to predict the situation in the whole Indus Valley, which is unrealistic.""

In any case, no map can tell villagers whether a specific well is contaminated. Arsenic concentration varies widely from pump to pump, and the only way to know for certain is to test each one.

Shallow wells are less likely to be tainted. Deeper ones, such as those run by the government's Drinking Water Filtration sites, may be more at risk.

This makes the problem especially acute for thousands of city-dwellers who have no access to clean water and rely on what the government supplies. At one Islamabad neighborhood filtration site on Wednesday, resident Ali Hasan said the struggle was real.

""It's the government's job to provide us with clean drinking water, but everywhere we have to travel to find clean water,"" Hasan said while filling a large plastic jug to take home to his neighborhood.

A survey submitted to Pakistan's parliament last year suggested nearly 80% of water sources in 2,807 villages across 24 districts were contaminated with bacteria or other pollutants, to levels that were unsafe to drink.

Now, ""the presence of arsenic in drinking water is becoming a widespread health problem,"" said Luis Rodríguez-Lado, a chemist with the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain who was not involved in the study. Yet ""there is a general lack of information"" about which areas in Asia are most at risk.

For Pakistan, Bukhari said, the problem is now urgent. Her department is already working with the U.N. Children's Fund to provide cheap anti-arsenic water filters to poor villagers in the worst-affected areas.

""We should immediately discourage the indiscriminate ground water exploitation,"" she said, noting that even city-dwellers with municipal water access were digging tube wells ""to have a lavish supply of water.""

But the country also needs to test countless tube wells and identify which have tapped into arsenic, possibly determining which depths might be safer, she said.

If researchers can find a depth at which ""there is no arsenic, we can dig wells that stop before the water is contaminated,"" Bukhari said."

"A couple who fell in love during the course of their gender reassignment surgeries at a city hospital and have now decided to get married received a death threat on Wednesday . The story of Aarav Appukuttan, who was previously known as Bindu, and Sukanyeah Krishna, previously Chandhu, went viral over the last three days, resulting in their Facebook pages getting inundated with messages as well. On Wednesday morning, the couple put up an appeal on a crowdfunding site seeking Rs 6 lakh for Sukanyeah's further surgeries. They have been undergoing treatment for the last couple of years at Andheri's Kokilaben Ambani Hospital; they met outside urologist Dr Sanjay Pandey's OPD clinic and connected immediately due to their common mother tongue. “On Wednesday , Sukanyeah called me saying there is a serious matter as a man has written a pithy message on her Facebook page saying that we should be killed,'' Aarav told TOI over the phone from Kottayam, where he is at present. Sukanyeah works in Bengaluru. The couple is now considering approaching the cyber police with a complaint. In an FB post uploaded on Wednesday evening, Sukanyeah wrote, “Ever since our marriage news went viral on the Internet, we are getting responses from people all around the world... obviously... mixed reviews.“ Her post further mentioned that a person named Mayank commented: “Kill them both“. The message has been posted from a fake profile, she added. Aarav , who is 46 years old, told TOI that they plan to marry at the earliest. “We are waiting for her surgeries to get completed; it should be within a month's time,“ he said."
"A draft national medical devices policy that could bring most medical devices within the ambit of price regulation while also outlining measures to boost local manufacturing of devices has been circulated by the Centre. The proposal, which comes soon after a draft national pharma policy , marks the continued government activism to reduce costs of medical care and control insurance payouts in view of steep treatment and hospitalisation expenses in the private sector. Currently, only a few critical medical devices are under indirect price control and 80% of all devices are imported products. This poses a challenge for the government when regulating prices of even select devices like stents or knee implants as it has to base its calculations on landed price of imports. The draft suggests creation of a national medical devices authority to promote local manufacturing as well as a separate pricing policy and a division under the national pharmaceutical pricing authority (NPPA) to regulate the price of such devices. “The government may announce a separate policy enunciating the principles for regulating prices of identified medical devices and implement the same by notifying a separate medical devices prices control order,“ the draft says. It suggests amending the Essential Commodities Act and the scope of NPPA's functions and, instead, create a separate body ­ national medical devices authority ­ to boost growth of the medical devices sector.The medical devices market in India is estimated at around $7 billion, growing annually at around 15%.The department will also meet industry bodies on Thursday at New Delhi's FICCI to discuss the draft policy . However, industry executives said the department has re-circulated a 2015 draft policy without changes though the industry has submitted its several recommendations. “We do not understand the purpose of this meeting.For pharmaceuticals, DoP has circulated a fresh draft, whereas in case of medical devices there are no changes in the draft even after two years of deliberations. We have already submitted our recommendations,“ says Rajiv Nath, forum coordinator for the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry. Civil society representatives say the draft policy does not consider patients' interest. It alleged that DoP has bypassed civil society and public health groups on draft pharma policy and medical devices. “The DoP denied us even an observer status in Thursday's meeting,“ Malini Aisola of the All India Drug Action Network, a civil society group, said. The draft policy also suggests DoP bring a detailed proposal for creation of the new authority in six months.The autonomous body will be under the DoP."

New Delhi: Punjab and Haryana are on the edge as the states await the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) court’s verdict on Friday in a case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who has been accused of raping two women at his ashram.

Section 144 (curfew) of the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code) has been imposed across Chandigarh, as more than 40,000 of Ram Rahim’s followers have congregated at Naam Charcha Ghar in Panchkula area.

The Chandigarh Police is bracing for any outbreak of violence on Friday, after the CBI court’s verdict, which is scheduled for 2:30pm. The Director General of Chandigarh Police (Law and Order), Tejinder Singh Luthra, has sounded a warning to all police personnel in this regard.

In a letter sent to all Inspectors General of Police and the DG of Punjab Police, Luthra has asked the Chandigarh police to step up vigil, following a tip-off on preparations being carried out by Ram Rahim’s followers.

“The Dera Sacha Sauda Sirsa premise has started storing petrol and diesel in drums in Faridkot district. They have stored stones and sharp-edged weapons on roofs on Naam Charcha Ghars,” the letter states.

While elaborate arrangements have been made to convert the Chandigarh cricket stadium into a “temporary prison” on Friday, to house all law breakers, all schools and colleges in the city have been instructed to remain shut on Thursday and Friday.

The Union home ministry has also extended support to the Haryana and Punjab governments, assuring them of all possible help, including from the central paramilitary forces. So far, more than 100 companies of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) have been deployed across Haryana and Punjab.

“All police personnel who were on leave have been recalled in preparation for Friday. There is absolute air-tight security around the city and we have ensured a zero-tolerance policy for any form of violence that is likely to take place. There is full cooperation with both state governments in this regard,” said a senior Central government official.

In 2002, the CBI had registered a case against the Dera Sacha Sauda head based on the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high courts."

"A new 200 rupee note will be soon available with the government giving its nod to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issue these notes, a move aimed at easing the pressure on availability of currency notes. The finance ministry has issued a notification saying that on the recommendations of the RBI board, “the central government hereby specifies the denomination of banknotes of the value of two hundred rupees“. The introduction of Rs 200 notes will help ease the problem people face with finding change for 2,000 rupee notes. Finance minister Jaitley said the timing of the re lease of the new notes would be announced by the RBI. “The whole process regarding by when the notes will be printed, RBI will take care of that issue. It would be appropriate for the RBI to announce dates and matters related to printing of notes,“ Jaitley told a conference after the Cabinet meeting. Asked whether there are moves to phase out Rs 2,000 notes, he said: “I have not heard any discussion on this.“ After the government announced its stunning move to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 rupee notes in November 8 last year, it introduced new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes. There were reports that the government will unveil Rs 1,000 rupee notes but so far it has not happened."

"A self-proclaimed email prankster posing as Ste ve Bannon tricked top Breitbart editors into agreeing to help bring down the former White House chief strategist's enemies. The Bannon impersonator sent emails from a fake account to editor-in-chief Alexander Marlow and other editors, who responded they would do Bannon's “dirty work“ against White House aides. When Marlow was asked by the fake Bannon whether he could have Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner ousted from the White House, the editor responded he would see what he could do to have them “packed and shipping out before Christmas“. The prankster shared the emails with CNN. Bannon recently returned to the right-wing site after being fired from his position in Trump's administration.

"A special Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act) court in Jam Khambhalia taluka of of Devbhumi Dwarka district on Wednesday sentenced a man to 10 year rigorous im prisonment (RI) for raping minor daughter in 2015. According to the case details, the accused, Mehmo od Ismail Bhagad (43), a resident of Salaya in Jam Khambhalia, had repeatedly raped his 17-year-old daughter for three months when her brothers had been away for fishing in the sea. Bhagad had married twice. His first wife had committed suicide by setting herself ablaze after giving birth to four children. The rape survivor was the second child from Bhagad's first wife. Later Bhagad married another woman who later left him. “Bhagad raped his daughter when his sons went for fishing. He also threatened to set her ablaze if she complained to her brothers. After suffering for three months the girl summoned courage and complained about it to her maternal aunt who approached Salaya marine police station with a complaint against Bhagad on August 31, 2015,“ said an official from Salaya Marine police station.

"A team of army engineers has been deployed to build a floating bridge so that railway tracks can be repaired to restore train services between the Northeast and the rest of the country. The bridge is being built along the tracks that have been lying suspended since August 11 when the overflowing Mahananda washed away the soil beneath. The 60- metre stretch of the tracks between Sudhani and Telta stations in Bihar is the only stumbling block to restoring the train services. The floating bridge, known as the Kruppman bridge, is supported on inflated pneumatic rubberised floats and will enable machines like excavators to carry and unload boulders on the riverbed to fill up the void under the railway lines. Until now, boulders were being dumped manually by workers. Sources said the railways had sent a request to the army to pitch in. The railways had earlier said they expected the train services to resume by August 28. An official had, however, expressed doubt if the repairs would be complete by August 28.

"A year after he stepped down as governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) following personal attacks by a ruling party politician, Raghuram Rajan is set to launch his book. It will include his commentary and speeches on various issues, including the need for tolerance and respect to assure India's economic progress, for instance, or the connection between political freedom and prosperity . A statement issued by HarperCollins India said, “`I Do What I Do' (the book's title) offers a front-row view into the thinking of one of the world's most respected economists, one whose commitment to India's progress shines through in the essays and speeches here.“ Rajan, who was appointed governor by the UPA government when the rupee was in a free fall, left the RBI under unexplained circumstances.He was seen to be rubbing the NDA government up the wrong way by speaking on tolerance at a time when beef-related lynchings were in news.When Rajan's three-year term was nearing an end, he came under scathing attack from Subramanian Swamy , a BJP politician. Rajan had described the attacks as `ad hominem' (directed against him rather than the position he was holding) as one of the grounds on which he was attacked was for not being “mentally Indi an“. Adding to the mystery was the stony silence maintained by the government. Finally, Rajan announced that he would be returning to his old job as a professor at Chicago Booth School of Business. Various theories were floa ted on the abrupt exit of the young governor. The se included speculation that Rajan was sounded out on demonetisation (that followed three months after his exit) but was opposed to it. Another belief was that the government was unhappy with a freethinking RBI governor speaking on issues other than finance. According to the publishers, Rajan explains economic concepts in a readily accessible way: For instance, `Dosano mics' is the term coined to describe his simple explanation of inflation using dosa prices as a metaphor. The title of his book is taken from his famous riposte, “My name is Raghuram Rajan and I do what I do“, during a press conference when the media sought to impose labels on him. Rajan is understood to have told colleagues that he would maintain a low profile for a year and would not take up speaking assignments or write. C Rangarajan, former governor of RBI, in his comment on the book, said, “This book, packed with the weight of his intellect, charmingly convincing logic and down-to-earth dosa economics, is a welcome end to his one-year maun vrat.“"

Playing for South Africa is, and will always be, the greatest privilege of my life,“ he said. He missed the recent 3-1Test series defeat in England.

"Acting was never really in the scheme of things for Rachan Chandra, who, after spending most of his life in the Middle East, came to India to pursue engineering and subsequently handle the family business.Yet, he is all set to debut in Sandalwood soon with the Kannada remake of the Malayalam hit, Ustad Hotel, which had Dulquer Salmaan in the lead. Called Gowdru Hotel, the film, produced by Eminent Moviemakers, pits Rachan with actors like Prakash Raj and Vedhika. Excerpts from a chat.From an engineer to entrepreneur and now, actor. How did that happen?I am the son of a doctor couple, who grew up in the Middle East. I came to India to pursue my engineering degree, after which I took charge of the family business here. I have been handling it for the past 7-8 years and it is well set. I never had showbiz aspirations and was very happy in my space. Some of my close friends, though, were associated with a few production houses and that is how one of them, Ramesh, who is one of the producers of Gowdru Hotel, chanced upon the firm that held the remake rights for Ustad Hotel. He saw the film and then suggested that I do so as well.After we saw the film, all my friends said that this film would be just apt for me. In fact, barring the fact that the hero there is a chef and cooks, much of the story bears a strong resemblance to my own upbringing in the Middle East, return to India, etc. That drew me to the subject and I felt that maybe I could do it.How has the experience been?It's been quite the learning experience.Once it was decided that I will play the lead, director Pon Kumaran put me through the grinds with workshops to familiarize myself with facing the camera. But then no amount of training can help when you are actually on set, and, like most newcomers, I also had some starting trouble. But all my co-stars, including veterans like Prakash Raj, who plays my grandfather in the film, Kaddipudi Chandru, Ananth Nag and even Vedhika helped me get through my scenes. They were most cooperative.What can audiences expect from Gowdru Hotel?It is, no doubt, a remake, but while we have retained the essence of the subject, the biggest takeaway is that our version is a lot tighter. The original was at least 15 minutes too long. That apart, while Ustad Hotel was all about Suleimani black tea and biryani, in sync with the title of our film, we have changed that to our staple ragi mudde and so on. What audiences will also enjoy are the tracks by Yuvan Shankar Raja, which have come out beautifully . The original had music by Gopi Sunder and the tracks were m o s t l y melodies. Our sound track is a mix of differ ent gen res of music and will m a k e f o r wholesome lis tening. Now that you've tried your hand at acting, do you foresee yourself doing more roles?Well, I really enjoyed my Gowdru Hotel stint and I wouldn't mind doing other films. But I realize that I am not cut out for the run-of-the-mill commercial ventures. They won't suit me. In fact, I really admire the body of work that Dulquer has and believe that a similar trajectory with different kinds of subjects is what will work for me. But all said and done, my future in films will depend on how audiences warm up to me as an actor and our film."

A university in Bhopal recently floated a tender inviting proposals to build a cow shelter within its campus. The university -- which specialises in teaching students journalism and communications -- is setting up a new campus on the outskirts of Bhopal where they want to build a 'gaushala' that'll house cows of Indian breed.

Lajpat Ahuja, the rector of Makhanlal Chaturvedi Rashtriya Patrakarita Evam Sanchar Vishwavidyalaya, told The Telegraph that the new campus being built will have residential quarters for students and officials. He added that the decision on what all the campus will have was taken two years back in a meeting chaired by Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Chouhan.

""There will be a lot of residential quarters and hostels. The gaushala is being created to produce milk for the inmates. The cow dung can be used to generate bio-gas and grow vegetables on a small patch of land,"" Ahuja told Telegraph.

A university official told News18 Hindi that the land on which the cow shelter is being built is unfit for any other construction and runs along a nullah.

However, some students don't seem to be happy with the development. Outlook quotes a student saying, ""It is a shame that the university has no good books in the library, good camera equipment in the studios or good computers, it is planning to set up a cow shelter.""

Outlook adds that this isn't the first time the university has landed in a controversy. In the past, it's Vice-Chancellor BK Kuthiala apparently replaced a course on Nehruvian socialism with one on the ideals of Deen Dayal Upadhyay.

The unanimous wisdom of nine people decided today the extent to which the State can legitimately have access to, and control, the private lives of 1.3 billion Indians.

Based on the hearings regarding the constitutionality of the Aadhaar, a nine-member constitutional bench on Thursday ruled privacy to be a fundamental right of citizens, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. However, like all such rights, this one too is likely to be defined with reasonable restrictions, which may be exploited by state and non-state actors to manipulate their ways into the lives of citizens.

Nonetheless, the ruling is historic on several counts. We list here three broad spheres in which it is likely to have a palpable effect, empowering individuals to interact more confidently with the world and forcing the Indian state to reconsider its hold on the private affairs of its subjects.

Aadhaar

Although the ruling on right to privacy has its origins in the debate over the mandatory imposition of the Aadhaar scheme, its implications are much wider. With the establishment of the constitutional validity of the right to privacy, the hearings on Aadhaar will continue before the existing three-member bench, who will have a clearer framework to arbitrate over the issue.

While arguing in favour of the mandatory imposition of Aadhaar cards, the Centre has already dismissed the citizen's absolute rights over their bodies. In order to justify the linking of Aadhaar to paying taxes, it drew the example of fingerprints collected from suspected criminals under investigation, as though a civic duty, such as the paying revenues, could be meaningfully compared with a grave offence that can lead to arrest.

The government's attitude appears to derive from its confusion between privacy and secrecy. It's not out of any perverse desire to keep secrets that citizens have raised objections about handing over their biometric and other details to the state. Rather, the concern over Aadhaar pertains to worries over the state's ability to keep such personal information safe in the public domain.

As many as 130 millions Indians had their bank details and confidential data linked to Aadhaar leaked from government websites as of May 2017. Millions more remain vulnerable to more such breaches. Lawyers are hopeful that the verdict on privacy will act as a deterrent for the government's mission. ""This verdict is a setback for Aadhaar,"" as senior advocate Prashant Bhushan said, echoing the sentiments of many common citizens and activists lobbying against its draconian imposition.

WhatsApp

The acknowledgement of the right to privacy should have a decisive impact on the course of the WhatsApp case, which is currently being heard by the Supreme Court.

A bench of five judges is hearing a petition challenging popular messaging application WhatsApp's right to share information about its users with Facebook, the US social media giant that bought over the former in 2014. It is suspected that the data sharing policy between the two led to the breach of information of as many as 160 million users of WhatsApp in India.

The Indian government argues that privacy concerns by private bodies should be viewed differently from those related to the government. Even more ironically, the Centre invoked the same Article 21, also cited by the SC bench in its verdict, to justify its stand in the WhatsApp case that right to privacy is guaranteed through the right to life and personal liberty. But the Centre chose to ignore its own logic when it came to the fact that the same principle should apply to itself as well.

With a universal right to privacy now in place, it will be harder to pull off cases of such exceptionalism.

Civil rights

A legally recognised right to privacy is likely to challenge the ways in which personal laws operate in India, especially with regard to those that infringe on an individual's freedom of choice and expression. A prime example of such an instance is the law that criminalises sexual minorities for choosing alternative gender and sexual orientations.

In 2013, the apex court upheld Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which discriminates against a section of individuals in society on the basis of their sexual orientation, and placed the onus of repealing it on the Parliament. A writ petition, challenging Section 377 on the ground that it violates the privacy of citizens, is still pending.

In its ruling, the Supreme Court laid down three categories under which the term 'privacy' must fall for an individual to avail themselves of it as a fundamental right: ""It must prescribe a procedure; the procedure must withstand a test of one or more of the fundamental rights conferred under Article 19 which may be applicable in a given situation; and (iii) It must also be liable to be tested with reference to Article 14,"" as News18 puts it.

Now that Right to Privacy is upheld, the Supreme Court's earlier verdict on the rights of LGBTQ+ people is likely to be challenged on firmer grounds and, hopefully, lead to a positive conclusion.

"Afashion designer whips up authentic  fare from his home state at apop- up  that features curries, smoked fish and  pork made from traditional ingredients  Chembur KRUTIKA BEHRAWALA krutika. behrawala@ mid- day. com GROWING up in a conservative home in Imphal, Keisham Kunjakishor Singh, who goes by the names Keisham or Bung, wasn’t allowed to cook chicken and pork in his kitchen. “ My parents never stopped us from eating it but we couldn’t cook meat inside our home. So, I would bring the stove to our courtyard, and smoke pork outside. I also remember learning how to smoke fish at the age of 9 8 . That is considered vegetarian in most Manipuri homes,” says the : ; - year- old Manipuri fashion designer based in Mumbai, who moonlights as a home chef. This Sunday, he will offer a taste of both vegetarian and non- vegetarian fare from the northeastern state, at the pop- up titled Manipuri Chakhum, presented by Authenticook. Take a veggie walk The meal features 9 8 dishes, including Singju, a popular street snack served at female- run stalls known as potphams. It’s a salad made using cabbage, lotus root and fenugreek leaves, laced with several herbs. For the mains, you can seek comfort in Mangal Ooti, a dal featuring whole yellow peas cooked with bamboo shoot, brought in from his native town. “ I travel to Imphal every month and return with seasonal herbs, black rice, bhut jolokia and spices like bay leaves, Chinese chives and ginger. We grow most of them in our backyard,” says Keisham. He’ll use the pungent chive leaves in Maroi Bori Thongba, a curry with black gram and lentil dumplings, while the other spices will be used in Kangsoi, a popular Manipuri version of a stew made with fresh, seasonal vegetables like tomatoes, cabbage and potatoes. “ I grew up on this stew, and sticky rice. I’ll use my mother’s recipe to make it,” he adds. Also on the vegetarian menu is Chamfoot, a simple, steamed vegetable salad. Keisham has prepared accompaniments like Soibum Iromba ( fermented bamboo shoot chutney) and Kanglayen Iromba ( dry mushroom chutney). Know the difference The non- vegetarian menu stars Baah Gajor Gahori Tender, where chunks of pork are cooked with bamboo shoot and bhut jolokia chilli. “ The Manipuri style of cooking pork is vastly different from Naga pork, which usually is just boiled or steamed. We use several spices to cook the meats. I make my own spice mix with coriander, cumin, fenugreek seeds, and asafoetida.” Similarly, Yen Thongba, or chicken curry, is prepared by shallow frying the meat first and then boiling it in water to thicken it as gravy. The popup also features Nga Ataoba Thongba, comprising Rohu fish that is fried and curried in tomato. Keisham will also offer sticky rice that has been wrapped and cooked in lotus leaf. “ It’s the most traditional way of cooking it. The leaf infuses an aroma into the rice. For dessert, there’s Chakhao Kheer cooked with black rice. It’s something my father would cook for us in the afternoons when we were kids,” reminisces Keisham.

"After he hit the bull’s eye with Kaabil, Hrithik Roshan has been talked about in respect of one project – a biopic on the life of mathematician Anand Kumar. Patna-based Kumar has been the brain behind the ambitious programme Super 30 that spots 30 meritorious students among economically backward section of society and trains them to enter the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). The programme has a very high success rate.

Hrithik recently met Kumar, giving further buzz to the speculation. But is the actor playing Kumar in the project tentatively called Super 30? Speaking to DNA on Wednesday, Hrithik said, “I had a very nice meeting with him. He’s a fantastic person. Apart from the movie, I have engaged in a lot of other conversations with him about his life. It’s an extremely inspirational journey.”

However, he refused to confirm his participation in the film yet. “It’s too early to get into such details. I am also looking at many other scripts. Nothing is official right now. But yes, this seems like a very, very good journey for me to collaborate on. We have to wait for the official announcement,” he said.

After meeting Hrithik, Kumar had said, “I am aware that Hrithik doesn’t look anything like me. But I don’t think the physical resemblance is as important as understanding my personality. I feel Hrithik with his sensitive approach to characters will be able to project my thoughts, opinions and world view better than any other actor.”

Hrithik Roshan said he takes up a film only when the story appeals to him on an emotional level. “I keep my instincts in mind. I must do a film that appeals to the human side of me and not to the star (side). If it connects with me then it will connect with the fans and audiences,” he said in an interview here when asked about his process of choosing a film.

For the 43-year-old actor, the basic emotions of a story should strike a chord with him first. “There are times when the scene is supposed to be emotional and you imagine the audience crying but are you crying? The scenes in the film might seem very beautiful, but if the script has not moved me then it will not work (with the audience as well).”

To a question about the influence of sport in his and his children’s lives, he said, “I am going to push my kids to adopt some sports as it builds sportsmanship, character. It teaches you a lot of things, it teaches you survival.”"

Stardom beckoned and the 19-year-old was on the celebrity circuit doing television debates, speaking at conferences and endorsing products. He even wrote a book. Then the script changed. Unmukt failed to score big, his bat went cold and mismatch between performance and potential triggered a backlash. Unmukt’s fall was as dramatic as his rise. Last season, he temporarily lost his place in Delhi’s Ranji side. But why is Unmukt, someone expected to fly, struggling even to jog? Some say it’s technical confusion where a young player is unable to adjust to different formats. They point to Unmukt’s repeated failures to convert good starts, ordinary shot selection and tendency to go hard at the bowling when patience is a wiser option. Others feel Unmukt is ‘distracted’ and lacks focus, an unfair charge considering his outstanding work ethic. Maybe, Delhi cricket’s pervasive negativity that erodes the confidence of young players is responsible. Unmukt’s career is a reminder that cricket is cruel and success comes only when talent is aligned to taqdeer. Millions of kids play cricket in gullies/ grounds/maidaans and stadiums yet, in 85 years, from 1932 to 2017 (from Col CK Nayudu to Hardik Pandya), only 289 players have represented India. It is also difficult to ignore the similarity and irony surrounding the careers of Virat Kohli and Unmukt. Both are toporder batsmen who came through Delhi’s chaotic club cricket. Both stood out because of their raw talent. Both made the Ranji side when young. Both led India to wins in the under-19 World Cup. The similarities end there and soon Virat and Unmukt’s career took different trajectories. Virat went straight up after the World Cup moment in 2008 like a Diwali rocket ODI debut 2008, Test debut 2011, captain of India 2016. Today, he is on a different planet: No 1 batsman in the world with 13,000 international runs and 45 hundreds. Unmukt is not in the frame; Ranji place under threat and he is without an IPL contract. One observer who tracked both players explains the continued rise of the Indian captain. Kohli, he says, is a self-made champion who is sharp and fiercely ambitious. Strongly self confident, he discarded all doubts, rejected tradition and broke all mounds. Raised fitness levels defied convention about personal life and had multiple tattoos on his muscled arms. Unmukt is less flamboyant but a precious cricket talent. Only 24, he still has time to make the second innings count. Writer’s views are personal"
"Amid continued protests by slogan-shouting RJD members over Srijan fund transfer scam, the state legislative assembly on Wednesday passed five more bills without any debate. Though several amendments were moved, none could be taken up in the din created by RJD legislators. Assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary hurried through the bills before adjourning the House for the second time during the day on second consecutive day of monsoon session. The five bills are Bihar taxation (amendment and validation) bill, 2017, Bihar water and sewerage board (repeal) bill, 2017, Bihar state university service commission bill, 2017, Bihar state universities (amendment) bill, 2017 and Bihar medical (amendment) bill, 2017. The Bihar state university service commission bill, 2017 is for creating a commission, as existed before 2007, for appointment of teachers in the universities and constituent colleges in a timebound manner. The commission is expected to fill largescale vacancies, which is hampering quality in higher education. The commission will be headed by a chairperson and have up to six members. The maximum age for appointment as a chairperson will be 72 years and that for members 70 years. A chief secretary-rank official or one who has worked as a secretary or on an equivalent post at the Centre, a former vice chancellor or a renowned academician would be eligible for the post of chairperson. Of the six members, three will be of professor-rank with at least five years’ experience, while the rest three would be of joint secretary rank serving or retired officials of the state government. The Bihar state universities (amendment) bill, 2017 vests the power of sending recommendations for appointment of teachers in private affiliated colleges on the selection committees in universities, as the erstwhile Bihar college service commission could not send their recommendations for some reason earlier. The move is aimed at removing discrepancies, which come in the way of disbursal of funds following the abolition of unaided education policy in 2008. Now, the selection committees will vet and approve appointments in affiliated colleges. The Bihar medical (amendment) bill, 2017 makes provision for setting up of a medical council in the state in light of several changes since the Bihar Medical Act, 1916 came into effect. The council will be a 10-member body. It amends the 1916 Act, which also covered Orissa. The Bihar taxation (amendment and validation) bill, 2017 is aimed at validation of changes in the tax structure in light of goods and services tax, which came into effect from July 1, 2017. The Bihar state water and sewerage board (repeal) bill, 2017 was necessitated following the decision to merge the board with Bihar urban infrastructure development corporation. All the assets and liabilities will also be transferred to the board. n"
"Amole Gupte is a stark contrast from regular Bollywood film makers. While they enter an interview clutching multiple cellphones and looking hassled, this guy is cool as a cucumber. Dressed in shorts, a tee and wearing a perpetual smile he is super non-Bollywood. He doesn't believe in auditions because his method is different. Yet it works. In an interview with BT, the fountainhead talks about his journey in Bollywood, how he still feels he doesn't belong here and his upcoming directorial Sniff!!!, which features eight-year-old child artiste Khushmeet Gill in the lead role of a superhero, who can smell danger. While everybody is making superhero films with grown-up stars, you mostly make child-centric films. What is your affinity with this genre all about? What's wrong with Sunny Gill? He is perhaps more talented than many Alisters. Children are untouched. Their honesty and transparency can be seen in their eyes, and it is irreplaceable.My story is not about sharp people; it's about simple, innocent hearts. In my scenario, kids are my superstars. I respect and look up to them. Sniff!!! is a slice-of-life film around which a cutting-edge crime thriller has been woven. It can be consumed by all age groups. Talking about my affinity with children's films, I love all genres as a viewer. But as a practitioner and child-right activist, I like bringing to the fore chocolate-covered and sugarlaced issues through my films. It would be pointless to make films if I don't have an issue to share with the world. You seem to have become a child expert... I am just an observer, who is guided by them. See, children are not aware of their importance. My own son (Partho) was in two of my films. He won many awards, including the National Award.However, it did not show in his demeanour because we understand that the process is bigger than fame and glamour. Your son has achieved a lot of success at such a tender age. How do you keep him grounded? Most of the times, it is he who keeps me grounded. He is a filmmaker already . My wife and I treat him as an equal. We are not doing anybody , including our son, a favour. We are nobody to give him anything. My wife, my son and I are best buddies. From that friendship rises the scent of cinema, which we share and discuss. Considering the fact that your son is such a talented actor, why didn't you envision this film with him? When I asked him if he would make an appearance in Sniff!!!, he flatly refused saying that he was busy with his curriculum. As a father, I wanted him to make an appearance, but I respect his decision. Also, he has grown taller than me now, and this film is about an eight-year-old boy. So, if I had cast him, it would have been a high level of nepotism (laughs). Now that you have mentioned nepotism, what is your take on this much-debated issue? In every industry , sons and daughters take over their parents and that should not surprise anybody as the whole family breathes and speaks the same language. However, art is separate from the industry . The anomaly lies there.Because if it's an industry, can it be an art? Cinema is not for commercialisation. The profit of the entire industry might perhaps be lesser than that of a hair-oil manufacturer. Money perishes, good content lives on. We should be here for the art and not for the bazaar. The tagline of the film is `Danger Ki Smell Kya Hoti Hai?'. What smells of danger to you? For me, the smell of danger is when the society is in danger.And that is already very strong. The nucleus of the family is breaking away , old people are being cast away , and children and their likes and dislikes don't matter anymore. It's essentially becoming an `I, Me, Myself ' world. Do you try to live your own childhood through your films? During my childhood, we had trees to climb and marbles to play with. All those things have become obsolete now. Along with that, an entire way of living has become extinct. Those days, we were not brand-conscious. In fact, we were anti-brand snobs no matter how rich we were; we believed that humans were bigger than brands.Unfortunately , that doesn't hold anymore. The old caste system has been replaced by a new one, which is determined by how much money you have.These days, there are exclusive clubs and expensive schools. Children are not mingling with each other. This has resulted in the creation of two Indias -rich and poor -and that's what I am scared about. I belong with the poor and will always be with them. I share all my theatre and cinema learnings with the non-privileged. I don't call them underprivileged; they are just financially challenged. The workshop culture is prevalent in most of your films... See, I don't audition children. Because every time you audition them, there are other kids you reject, who go back feeling bad. One aspect of my workshop cul ture is that I bring in people to play themselves, which enables them to become the characters. They grow through the workshop because that in itself is a film process for me.We never carry a single piece of paper to the set; the lines are their own. With your kind of sensibilities and outlook towards cinema, where do you place yourself in the industry? I am quite clear that I have always been an outsider and want to be one. There is a much larger world of cinema and bigger masters elsewhere in the world.I come from Marathi cinema, which is very strong. I am holding onto my lineage and won't compromise on the aesthetics and understanding of the art form. I will definitely not sacrifice it for financial gains. An insider has to go through a lot of submissions, but I don't submit, I have a stiff neck; I have spondylitis (laughs). I wouldn't care if people found it difficult to work with me. If nobody allows me to make a film, I will paint and if I am not allowed to paint, I will cook. I have never worked a single day of my life. I do everything for pleasure and the process."
"Among all the reliable methods of weight loss, flaxseeds are one of the most effective foods that help you lose extra kilos. Enriched with fibre, Omega 3 fatty acids and antioxidants, flaxeeds increase your body's efficiency to lose weight. These tiny brown seeds with distinct flavour are obtained from the flax plant, whose fibre is used to produce linen. How flaxseeds help in weight loss? Dietary Fibre Flaxseeds are a great source of dietary fiber. Dietary fiber is classified into two categoriessoluble and insoluble. The soluble fiber produces a gel-like substance which when encounters the digestive juices and water, slows down the food absorption in your colon and in turn, makes you feel fuller for a longer time. The insoluble fiber helps in promoting the good gut bacteria which aids digestive health and increases your metabolic rate. Essential Fatty Acids The reason they are referred to as essential fatty acids are that they can only be obtained from healthy food sources. Flaxseeds are loaded with two essential fatty acids, omega-3 and omega-6. These essential fatty acids obtained from flaxseeds are converted to phospholipids, an integral part of the cell membrane structure. Once we ingest them, omega-3 and omega6-fatty acids get converted to prostaglandin, which bal ances the metabolism.Prostaglandins derived from omega-3 fatty acids help in reducing inflammation. Inflammation can induce weight gain as it can increase oxidative stress. Proteins Flaxseeds are rich in proteins. So, when you consume a teaspoon of flaxseeds, along with dietary fiber, the protein content suppresses your appetite. This prevents you from overeating, thereby helping you in losing weight. Low Carb Flaxseeds are low in starch and sugar, hence they are not high on calories. Eating them regularly is good for your health and helps in losing weight. Antioxidants Antioxidants, which are also called lignans are abundant in flaxseeds. Though they don't have a direct link to weight loss, but they enhance the cell functioning as your body burns fat. Lignans also provide nutritional support and protects against free radicals. This is how you can use flaxseeds to lose weight. Not many of us know that ground flaxseeds or milled flaxseeds are more effective for losing weight. This is because the whole flaxseeds make it difficult for the digestive system to absorb all the nutrients present in them.On the other hand, ground flaxseeds are easily absorbed and there are more chances that you get the essential fats, proteins and dietary fiber present in them. How much flaxseeds are required to lose weight? As flaxseeds are nutrientrich, a tablespoon is enough.According to the health experts, one tablespoon of flaxseeds per day helps in losing weight. This also improves your overall health. How to eat flaxseeds? Sprinkle a few flaxseeds seeds over a cold cereal. You can also stir it into hot cereal like oatmeal. You can also add 1 tablespoon of flax seeds into your smoothie. You can also use flaxseed oil to make an omega-3packed vinaigrette for any salad. Use flaxseeds in the dressing of tuna, chicken or egg salad."
"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch police have arrested a second suspect in relation to a threat in Rotterdam where a rock concert was canceled after a tip from Spanish authorities, NOS said on Thursday.

The arrest was made earlier Thursday in the south of the Netherlands, NOS said.

"An 88-year-old resident of Satellite lodged a Rs 1.2 lakh theft complaint against his domestic help at Satellite police station on Tuesday.Victim Jitendralal Dekhtawala, who resides at New Alaknandan flats, near Azad society in Satellite, stated in his complaint that he and his wife had arranged a domestic help, named Hemendran Yadav for household work a few months back as they were living alone.   On Tuesday, the senior citizen found Rs 1.2 lakh in cash missing from his locked cupboard. When Yadav went missing on Monday, the couple realised that he must have broken into their locked room between August 18 and 22 and looted the amount and fled.   Due to the non-availability of Yadav’s address or any other details related to him, police are finding it hard to trace him. It is to be noted that police keep asking Amdavadis, particularly senior citizens, to give details of their domestic help to the concerned police station for verification of criminal record, before giving them job in vain. It even asks the citizens to submit details when they are going on a vacation to avoid break-in cases."
"ANDREW W. LYNGDOH Shillong, Aug. 23: The abode of clouds rides on the fame of the cleanest village in the continent. Now, Meghalaya is aiming to make its capital, Shillong, spanking clean too. Anyone caught littering the streets or tourist spots from today is liable to be arrested and fined up to Rs 5,000. East Khasi Hills superintendent of police Davis N. R. Marak today issued a notice where residents and tourists have been "" advised"" to maintain order on public roads, streets and all tourist spots in the district and desist from causing obstruction, injury or annoyance to passersby or indulging in "" pollution and littering"" on public roads and tourist spots. Shillong is the district headquarters of East Khasi Hills. "" Any person not obeying the orders issued is liable to be arrested under Section 102 of the Meghalaya Police Act, 2010, and on conviction by a court of law, shall be liable to a fine of Rs 5,000,"" it said. At the same time, tourists have been advised to carry garbage bags in their vehicles in which wrappers, empty snack packets or water bottles can be disposed of before dropping them in appropriate garbage bins. East Khasi Hills is home to tourist spots in Shillong, Sohra, Mawlynnong, Smit, Mawphlang and Mawsynram. Hundreds of tourists, mostly domestic, arrive in hordes, especially during summer and monsoon. A majority of them drive to Sohra to witness the cascading waterfalls. Many also visit Mawlynnong, located close to the Indo- Bangladesh border, dubbed the "" cleanest village"" in Asia. However, apart from Mawlynnong where tourists usually desist from littering, most of the tourist spots end up strewn with leftovers and other garbage. Shillong, which ranked 276 out of 434 cities and towns in the Swachh Survekshan 2017, is working overtime to clean its image. Marak said the notice was issued as part of an ongoing campaign to keep the capital and the district clean. A supervisory committee, headed by the chief secretary, monitors the cleanliness and hygiene in Shillong. The committee first met in June this year, and has had 11 meetings so far. The committee has representatives from the urban affairs department, Shillong Municipal Board, Shillong Cantonment Board, Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council, Shillong police and Hima Mylliem ( Mylliem state). To come up with ideas to make Shillong more liveable, the urban affairs department will organise the Hackathon 2017 next month where the best minds will come up with solutions on detection of non bio- degradable waste , open dumping of waste, cleanliness in commercial and tourist spots, water leakage and a host of other issues."
"ANITAJOSHUA New Delhi, Aug. 23: The spotlight was on Muslim women yesterday like never before after the Supreme Court struck down instant triple talaq as unconstitutional. So overwhelming was the support for the verdict that even the women's wing of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, which had contested any court interference in the personal law of Muslims, drifted along. The women's arm said the court's decision would have little impact as the practice of unilateral divorce in one sitting was not as prevalent as had been made out. Asma Zehra, the chief organiser of the board's women's wing, said in a statement: "" As the triple talaq practice is already vanishing in the Muslim community, this judgment will have very little impact on society. Talaq is a nonissue and divorce rate is the least in the Muslim community. Muslims have divorce rate of only 0.5 per cent."" According to the 2011 census, the divorce rate among Hindus is 0.76 per cent. She condemned the perceived politicisation of the issue. "" The ruling party, the fringe elements and the socalled ' Muslim women' organisations who had initiated this media campaign and movement against triple talaq couldn't get much out of the judgment."" However, Zakia Soman of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, a rights- based mass organisation that was one of the petitioners in the case, described the verdict as "" historic"" and the result of a "" tough struggle that ordinary women fought despite many threats from well- entrenched forces"". The verdict notwithstanding, Zakia is gearing herself for the long haul and is not too hopeful of a law for regulating divorce among Muslims being enacted within six months. "" It would require a lot of deliberation. The Hindu Marriage Act took over four years of deliberation. This cannot be done in a hurry,"" she told The Telegraph . The Andolan, which had brought out a study listing 117 cases of instant triple talaq , is clear that any such law has to be Quran- based. "" We were opposed only to instant and unilateral triple talaq . We want talaq- e- ahsan ( divorce over three lunar cycles) with the option of khula ( where woman can also apply for divorce),"" Zakia pointed out, adding that in asking the government to enact a law, the Supreme Court had endorsed the Andolan's demand for Parliament to draft a Quran- based family law. A joint statement issued by several women's organisations, including the Bebaak Collective, noted that a major departure had been made from earlier judgments by the Supreme Court "" in arguing that the practice of triple talaq is both un- Quranic and unconstitutional"". The statement said the judgment was based on the tenets of equality, dignity and secularism as enshrined in the Constitution. "" It is also a departure from the isolated adjudication in independent cases and paves the way for larger change for the women,"" it said. The statement raised a toast to the Muslim women who "" fought everyday patriarchy within religious institutions and the family, as well as communal forces, to seek justice and equality from the courts"". Noor Zaheer, the author of the book Denied by Allah and president of the Delhi unit of the National Federation of Indian Women, said this was just the beginning as the court had not looked into several issues, including a woman's right to seek divorce on equal terms as a man or maintenance for the divorced wife commensurate with the standard of living of her former husband even if she has no child to bring up. The BJP tried to pitch the Supreme Court's verdict scrapping instant triple talaq as the result of the "" persistent, unequivocal and firm stand taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi"". Television channels vied with each other to claim credit, highlighting their "" campaign"". However, none of this would have been possible without Muslim women speaking up and taking their battle to court. Five women were the only individuals named in the verdict among the petitioners: SHAYARA BANO The first step was taken by Shayara in early 2016 when she approached the Supreme Court with the plea to nullify her husband's decision to divorce her unilaterally and with immediate effect from October 10, 2015, with the three words "" talaq, talaq, talaq "". The Allahabad- based couple had been married for 14- and- a- half years and had two children. According to Shayara, a post- graduate in sociology from Uttarakhand, her husband and his family began harassing her for more dowry soon after marriage, torturing her and even administering medicines that caused memory loss. In April 2015, her husband left her in Moradabad after informing her Kashipur- based parents. The two lived separately from then on. His claim, however, was that Shayara left their home on her own in April 2015 and refused to return. AAFREEN REHMAN Hers too is a case of dowry harassment. Married in 2014 through a matrimonial site, Aafreen's in- laws allegedly began demanding more dowry from the beginning, even resorting to physical violence. Since her family had spent a considerable amount on the marriage, the Jaipur girl decided to brave it out. In 2015, Aafreen's husband left her in Jaipur. During a journey to Jodhpur a few months later, she met with an accident in which her mother was killed. Her husband visited her once but a couple of months later, while recuperating in Jaipur, she received divorce papers — with "" talaq, talaq, talaq "" via post without any prior message. Although Aafreen had heard about instant triple talaq , it was only when the axe fell on her marriage that she actually gave it a thought. She came in contact with the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan ( a rights- based mass organisation), heard about Shayara's fight and decided to join forces. ISHRAT JAHAN Bihar- born Ishrat was divorced by her husband of 15 years over telephone. The husband called her up from Dubai in April 2015, uttered the three words with the ring of finality and disconnected the phone. Before he had moved to Dubai for a job, the couple used to live in Howrah where they had four children — three girls and a boy. The birth of the three girls was apparently a sore point with her husband but relations between the two did not improve even after the son was born. Soon after the divorce, he remarried and also took away the children from Ishrat. Abandoned to a life of near penury, Ishrat decided to fight back, not just contest the instant divorce but also demand the return of her children and maintenance for their upbringing till they were in a position to fend for themselves. Most of all, what Ishrat wanted was justice as she refused to accept the divorce over phone. GULSHAN PARVEEN A native of Rampur in Uttar Pradesh, Gulshan's marriage was cut short by her husband in 2015 because "" he felt like it"". She was left homeless with her two- year- old son. In her case, she was visiting her parents when she received the divorce papers. Gulshan refused to accept the divorce and her husband went to a family court seeking dissolution of the marriage. She later told the Supreme Court that her in- laws used to harass her for more dowry. One of the reasons why she decided to contest the dissolution of marriage was her desire to bring up her son in a family atmosphere. ATIYA SABRI The most recent of the cases to be added to the list of women filing petitions in the Supreme Court individually is Atiya. Her case was added to the bunch of petitions in January. Married in 2012 and divorced in 2015 — well over a year before she mustered the courage to brave entrenched patriarchy to approach the court — Atiya is a mother of two. In her case, the divorce was just a piece of paper, not even the Rs 10 stamp paper that Gulshan's husband had sent. ANITA JOSHUA Zeenat Ali Siddiqui, who was divorced by her husband through instant triple talaq in 2015, wailed with joy. "" Thousands, millions of women are crying at home,"" she said, speaking to journalists outside the Supreme Court. Her husband had divorced her without giving any reason, leaving her to parent their two children alone. "" Narendra Modi has ended the practice of men throwing their women out for trivial reasons like making the lentils too sour,"" she said. "" When this happens to women, they are looked at with an evil eye. I know how it feels, because it has happened to me."" Picture by Prem Singh"
"Are you an adult in love with another adult? Do you want to spend time together, but not get married? Go directly to jail, do not pass go, do not collect . 200. Because not only are you a sin` ner, you are a “social terrorist“. Doing the unthinkable, consensually living with another adult. Infecting society one live-in relationship at a time. What could be wrong with two consenting adults wanting to live together without breaking any law, you ask? A lot, according to Prakash Tatia, Rajasthan Human Rights Commission chairperson, who has decided to take his job very seriously , and do what he must to protect the rights of humans -including those of you who are living in sin. According to Tatia, retired chief justice of Jharkhand High Court and former judge of Rajasthan High Court, no less, live-in relationships are `social terrorism'. “What sort of freedom is this... without notice, (people) start living in with someone else, then a third person... this is infecting the society .“Why is Tatia so concerned? He feels that if our children are to meet someone in a live-in relationship, they will also immediately start craving one. Tatia seems to be a man easily frightened. According to him, live-in couples bring a “sense of insecurity“ where they live, creating a “sense of fear, which virtually creates terror.... There may be fights. I am not saying the people who are fighting are right, but it's the reality .... The question is whether it's a better alternative to marriage?What is the control of society... who will intervene when things go wrong?“ He has a point, because it has been a while since the government or the courts started peeping into our homes and bedrooms and telling us whom to marry or have sex with. The `control of society' is of paramount importance in our country .Keeping things topical, Tatia also claimed that live-in relationships are more detrimental to women than even triple talaq. The status of women `abandoned' from a live-in relationship was “worse than divorced women“. A statement that in one fell swoop makes women into victims and makes divorce a permanent scar marring only women.“Two consenting adults don't have the right to end the dignity of the entire society... live-in relationships need to be registered like a marriage... terminating the marriage also should go through a legal process.“ If Tatia is talking about palimony , that precedent was set in India in 2015, when the Supreme Court ruled that if an unmarried couple was living together as `husband' and `wife', they would be considered to be legally married.The apex court had said that the woman would be eligible to inherit her part ner's property after the latter's death. In 2013, the Supreme Court had also requested that Parliament should amend the Domestic Violence Act to protect the interests of women and children in live-in relationships. Registering our live-in relationships legally will make it tantamount to marriage.Clever Tatia. In February , Tatia had asked people to share their opinion on live-in relationships. Based on which he would make recommendations to the govern ment. Because “what is the status of their children? We have to bear in mind that society has yet to accept live-in relationships... such children are not accepted in schools or in society .“ I would strongly advise Tatia to step ou of his ivory , prejudiced little tower and see that the world has changed. And it's not just Tatia. The Rajasthan State Women's Commission is suppos ed to launch a campaign against live-in relationships. Not a good advert for Rajasthan. Commission chairperson Suman Sharma has said that such relationships were “against our culture“ that women “suffered the most when such relationships ended“ and “that there was no provision to help women in such a case“. We, women, should really be touched by the concern shown for us by the judi ciary and the legislature. These comments follow the ruling of the Kerala High Court last week nullifying an alleged `love jihad' marriage by stating, “Marriage being the most important decision in her [Akhila's] life can only be taken with the active involvement of her parents.... The marriage, which is alleged to have taken place, is a sham and is of no consequence in the eye of law. Her husband has no authority to act as the guardian.“ And Akhila has no free choice. Moving. Especially since all these ab surd decisions underline the fact that the be all and end all is that a woman must marry -someone whom her par ents choose. And that even as an adult she has no rights. With protectors like this, who needs enemies?"

"As many as 1,042 people died of swine flu till August 20 this year, according to the Health Ministry. Of these, 342 casualties were in August alone. Maharashtra saw the most number of deaths at 437, followed by Rajasthan at 269 and Goa at 69, IANS reported on Thursday citing data released by the Centre.

So far in 2017, 22,186 H1N1 cases have been recorded in India. Maharashtra leads here, too, with 4,245 cases, followed by Goa with 3,029, Tamil Nadu with 2,994 and Karnataka with 2,956. Delhi recorded 1,416 cases of H1N1 infections, Kerala 1,374, and Rajasthan 651.

The figures have risen drastically since 2016, when only 1,786 swine flu cases were registered and 265 people had died. However, it is an improvement from that in 2015, which saw the worst swine flu outbreak with 42,592 cases and 2,990 deaths.

"Asia's oldest and South Asia's only natural ice skating rink, which is located in Lakkar Bazaar of Shimla, is all set to get a Rs 50-crore facelift under the Shimla Smart City Mission. As per a Smart City Mission document, Rs 44 crore will be spent under public private partnership (PPP) mode and the remaining Rs 6 crore with the convergence from urban sports infrastructure funds.Once redeveloped, the ice rink will have a complete modern touch, in which the present rink will be covered with a glass and concrete structure to provide a round-the-year artificial skating rink for public. Shimla resident, international ice skating champion and rink life-term member Peter Ta Tung said when he used to skate, the condition of the rink was good as its surroundings were covered with trees, which helped in forming ice. “When the trees were cut and authorities tried to disturb the ground without much research, the rink started degrading. The area needs to be preserved with proper research so that it does not get perished, “ he added."

'We haven't had any discussions yet. Those things may happen after the competitive zone is over and done with the series. I think that will happen after September 6 if it has to happen from their end.'

He is open to the idea of discussing Sri Lanka's transitional issues with their coach Nic Pothas, but India skipper Virat Kohli will only do it once he is done with the ongoing limited overs series.

Kohli was asked about Pothas' comment that they would interact with the Indian team management to overcome the transition period difficulties their team is facing currently.



""We haven't had any discussions yet. Those things may happen after the competitive zone is over and done with the series. I think that will happen after September 6 if it has to happen from their end,"" Kohli said in Pallekele on Wednesday, on eve of the second ODI against Sri Lanka.



The hosts' team bus was subject of angry reaction from fans at Dambulla after a crushing nine-wicket defeat in the first ODI.



Kohli spoke about how India managed the transition phase after many of their own greats retired.



""...But look it is difficult for any team going through transition. One thing that we decided to do as a team was take more responsibility and ownership of what we do on the field when playing for the country. We just needed to change our mindset.""



Mental preparation was key to standing upto challenges, according to the captain.



""It didn't matter if we were playing against a side that has played 60 Tests each – if we are mentally more prepared than them then we are in a better position to win. So we decided to put our heads in that zone where experience didn't matter much for us.



""It was the fight and competitiveness we were willing to show and the desire to fight for longer periods that helped us get through that phase quicker than what others might have faced,"" said the skipper.



Kohli said extreme reactions from fans are beyond the players' control and they would rather focus on the task at hand only.



""I am not someone who will sit here after not performing and request the fans to be patient with us or (tell them) 'please don't react in a bad way'. That's a very personal choice.



""If I, as a fan, am watching a game and I see a team not being able to do well I would feel compassion. I would not burn effigies or smash faces, put on mannequins and what not. I would show compassion because you can understand at a human level that everyone's trying hard out there and no one wants to go out there to lose or fail.""



""I think people find the ease and convenience, and the pleasure in pulling other people down which I personally don't believe in,"" he added.



""I'm sure it's tough for the players to see such things. But you can't really control what's happening from another person, you can only control what you can do on the park and the mindset that you can be in.""



Last but not the least, the topic of Lasith Malinga also came up as he is seen by many as a fading star in this young and inexperienced Sri Lankan line-up.



Asked about Malinga, Kohli said, ""Obviously, age is always a factor in sport. I cannot speak for Lasith but everyone wants to keep up with their peak fitness and manage their bodies well through the course of their career. When you look at his bowling action and the kind of success he has had for such a long period of time is actually remarkable.



""With the dynamics of his bowling, it's not very natural. What he has been able to achieve for Sri Lanka has been outstanding. That's why they have been such a dangerous side over the last few years in limited overs format,"" said Kohli.



The India captain believes that Malinga could still get back into his groove.



""Even when he played Test cricket, he made an impact. It's very easy to say that he is not bowling as well anymore but it could just be a phase. Once he starts hitting those yorkers again, those slower balls again, and picks up wickets on a regular basis then these talks can be otherwise also.



""I can't talk about his body, only he would know. But as long as we play him we obviously respect his skills and what he can bring to the table and how he can turn the game around.



""We always play him like that, we have always played him like that and we'll continue to play him like that till he plays for Sri Lanka,"" Kohli stated."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked all wings of the government to work in a synchronised manner and pressed the bureaucracy to take speedy decisions, promising that “honest decision-making with good intention would always be encouraged.”

Good governance should be a priority for the officers, he said during an interaction with a group of over 70 additional secretaries and joint secretaries in the central government, according to a PMO statement.

Modi asked the officers to focus attention on the 100 most backward districts of India, so that they can be brought up to the national average level, on various development parameters.

The prime minister said the combination of development and good governance is essential for the welfare and satisfaction of citizens, the statement said about the interaction that took place on Wednesday.

He emphasised the need for all wings of the government to work in harmony and synchronisation to achieve the best possible results, it added.

Underlining the importance of breaking silos, he pressed for efficient internal communication between various departments of the government.

Modi said all officers must keep the poor and the ordinary citizens in their minds while taking decisions, the PMO said.

The prime minister said this was a unique opportunity for the officers to deliver their utmost for the benefit of the nation.

He underlined the necessity of speed and efficiency in decision-making and said that honest decision-making with good intention would always be encouraged by the union government, the statement said.

During the interaction, officers shared their experiences on subjects such as a digital and smart governance, administrative procedures and accountability, transparency, doubling of farmers' income, skill development, Swachh Bharat, consumer rights, environment protection, and building of New India by 2022, the PMO said.

The prime minister said the world is looking towards India with positive expectations.

He said the entire world feels that a successful India is vital for a global balance.

There is also a strong undercurrent for excellence from the common citizens of India, he said, adding that youth from humble backgrounds, with very limited resources are achieving best positions in competitive exams and sports.

He asked the officers to work to promote this spontaneous upsurge of talent, recalling the spirit and energy that they themselves would have possessed in the first three years of their service.

"Author Aditya Kripalani, who is now directing a movie based on his bestseller, Tikli & Laxmi Bomb, says the world is moving towards equality of the two genders

Mona

Powerful patriarchy

Language of his own

For Aditya Kripalani, writing is a way of finding, expressing and relating to the world. Three of his books — Back Seat, Front Seat, Tikli & Laxmi Bomb — move in a world that challenges patriarchal system. And soon, you will see his stories on 70mm screen. Having completed the shoot of Tikli & Laxmi Bomb (the book by the same name won international recognition), this writer, director and producer of this debut film is busy cutting the trailer. “Two sex-workers decide to kick men out of the system and form a co-operative, which runs a business where the end consumer is a man. Would these women make past the overarching and overbearing patriarchy...is what the film is all about,” he says.Chitrangada Chakraborty and Vibhawari Deshpande play the lead roles. An intense plot, Aditya mentions how men who are supposed to be protectors of women turn predators. Can women actually beat patriarchy? “Well, I am all for a world that has 50:50 participation and I am glad that we are inching towards it.” As the film releases by the year-end, he aims at turning his debut novel, Back Seat, into a film too. He is also in the process of writing his fourth book titled Driver’s Seat. Training at the Film and Television Institute of India has helped his career. “Filmmaking sure is one profession where no qualification is required, but life is certainly easy if you know your tools well,” he says. He gives an example of digging a field with the hands, “One can surely do without a spade, but certainly it is way easier if you use the spade.”A film enthusiast, Aditya has followed closely different directors and their cinematic language. It’s the language of his own that he wants to create. Apart from writing and filming, he practices karate. Having learnt under Sensei Pervez Mistry, popularly known as ‘Father of Karate in India’, has left him many kilos lighter and way fitter. Being a foodie, street-food is his weakness and he loves to explore it wherever he goes. Self-discipline is the key to maintaining a balance between indulgence and exercise. “One cannot but be self-disciplined if one wants to do well as an independent director and producer.”

"B eijing's foreign policy in Asia has been expansionist since the turn of the century. China has expanded territory in the Asia- Pacific region on revanchist rationale. It has dominated the discourse by rebuffing regional and extra- regional authorities like the countries with which it has territorial disputes and the Permanent Court of Arbitration. China is now working on policies that will carry the expansionist momentum further west. The Indian Ocean region has seen unprecedented rise in Chinese activity. The building of a series of ports around India is being seen as an attempt to encircle it. The setting up of military and commercial facilities in Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Pakistan have been followed by the commissioning of a naval base at Djibouti, East Africa. The steadily growing submarine presence of the naval wing of the People's Liberation Army has further compounded the strategic riddle for India. Even as New Delhi mulls a response to these challenges, Beijing has upped the ante on continental fronts near the Indo- China border. The latest instance being at Doklam. The Chinese advance in Doklam would affect India's interests both directly and indirectly. Directly, the road that China is trying to build in Bhutanese territory would affect the connectivity between India's mainland and the Northeast, linked by a narrow stretch of land called the ' chicken's neck' or the Siliguri Corridor. Indirectly, China's attempt to build a road in Bhutan undermines Article 2 of the India- Bhutan Friendship Treaty, which states that both countries ""... shall cooperate closely with each other on issues relating to their national interests. Neither Government shall allow the use of its territory for activities harmful to the national security and interest of the other."" It is important to see the larger design in China's westward advance in Asia and the real reason behind its frustration with New Delhi. The singular roadblock to the progress of China's multi- billion pet project, the One Belt One Road, is New Delhi. India neither agrees with the China- Pakistan Economic Corridor, as it violates India's sovereignty, nor does it support the Maritime Silk Route, which strengthens the ' string of pearls' theory, propounding a strategic encircling of India by China. Besides, India, together with Bhutan, not only opted out of the multilateral congregation to discuss the OBOR initiative, held in May this year in Beijing, but also hastened the process of finalizing the International North- South Transport Corridor, considered to be a counter to OBOR. As such, the Doklam crisis and the consequent high- pitched rhetoric from Beijing appear to be direct consequences of the Indo- Bhutanese rebuff of the OBOR summit. China is resorting to pressure tactics to either try and coerce India into joining the OBOR initiative or to isolate India both regionally and in the regions that it considers its ' extended neighbourhood'. The balance in Asia is hinged precariously on rapidly shifting alliances. India's growing proximity to the United States of America, primarily through large- scale defence imports and increasing partnership in the Indo- Pacific region, has been offset by the recent strategic propinquity between Islamabad and Beijing. While India has partnered with the US and Japan in the Malabar naval exercises, Chinese investments in Pakistan almost make the latter appear to be a colony of the former. Russia, however, remains a wild card in this great game. It has ties with India, China as well as Pakistan. These realignments have brought new dynamism and competitiveness, hitherto unseen, within the larger Asian domain. It is these reformulations that make a US- China war in the Asia- Pacific region and an Indo- China war in South Asia look probable. In the fortunate absence of war, a fierce jostling between the major powers with unpredictable outcome is certainly on the cards."

"Be honest. Do you know you keep your partner awake at night with snores that could only be described as akin to those a farm animal makes? Or are they the ones who get an elbow to the ribs when they let out an echoing snore around the bedroom? Whoever the culprit is, it would be helpful to get some tips on how to stop it, right?Here are the best tips to stop snoring with some simple lifestyle changes. 1. Maintain a healthy weight and diet Being overweight by just a few kilograms can lead to snoring. Fatty tissue around your neck squeezes the airway and prevents air from flowing in and out freely. 2. Try to sleep on your side Try to sleep on your side rather than your back. While sleeping on your back, your tongue, chin and any excess fatty tissue under your chin can relax and squash your airway.Sleeping on your side prevents this. 3. Avoid alcohol before going to bed Avoid alcohol before going to bed.Alcohol causes the muscles to relax more than usual during a normal night's sleep. This added relaxation of the muscles makes the back of the throat collapse more readily, which then causes snoring. 4. Quit or cut down on smoking Quit or cut down on smoking.Cigarette smoke irritates the lining of the nasal cavity and throat, causing swelling and catarrh. If the nasal passages become congested, it's difficult to breathe through your nose because the airflow is decreased. 5. Keep your nasal passages clear Keep your nasal passages clear, so that you breathe in through your nose rather than your mouth. If an allergy is blocking your nose, try antihistamine tablets or a nasal spray. Ask your pharmacist for advice, or see your GP, if you're affected by an allergy or any other condition that affects your nose or breathing, such as sinusitis. 6. Try an over-the-counter remedy The British Snoring and Sleep Apnoea Association website has details of a variety of treatments you can try at home, including pillows, Snore Calm products, mouthguards, nasal strips and dilators, as well as mouth-breathing devices. 7. Visit your GP If your snoring persists, it might be necessary to seek medical help. For some cases of snoring, surgery to fix structural problems in the airways, such as enlarged adenoids, is necessary. If your snoring is caused by looseness in your soft palate (the soft upper part at the back of the mouth), a technique called radiofrequency ablation, which uses heat energy to tighten the palate, may help."

"BHOPAL\KHANDWA: Beat this incentive: build toilets on time and win a trip to Goa. This is the brainwave of Madhya Pradesh government official Rajkumar Kaithwas, who has decided to sponsor the Goa trip by train for three persons each from three gram panchayats of Bagmar that complete the task the fastest. Kaithwas, the panchayat coordinating officer in Bagmar sector of Khandwa district, about 285km southwest of state capital Bhopal, announced his incentive last week in a push for Swachh Bharat (Clean India) Mission. Construction of toilets picked up pace across all 11 gram panchayats in Bagmar after his announcement and also caught the eye of his seniors, who are assessing options to implement the scheme throughout Khandwa. Kaithwas estimates he will have to spend around ₹1 lakh to sponsor the Khandwa to Goa trip for the nine winners. “The government pays me a good salary, it won’t be a problem,” he said. On the excitement his offer has triggered, he said, “Leave alone Goa, no one in the area has even seen a sea beach. They are naturally thrilled.” The winners will be from among sarpanchs, panchayat secretaries and employment assistants. “Execution of the work depends on representatives of these three categories. They work hard to reach targets, but do not get any incentive. I hit upon the idea to sponsor the trip to Goa as an ‘extra’ to motivate them,” said Kaithwas. Bagmar’s panchayats have less than 40 days to win the Goa trip. Khandwa intends to declare itself as Open Defecation Free by October 2. “Every sarpanch is holding meetings to motivate people and some are even chipping in with funds. Everyone wants to go to Goa,” said Kaithwas. Mamta Patel, the employment assistant at Bagmar panchayat, said, “We are all enthused by the offer. Our target was to complete 250 toilets. Now, only 28 remain to be built. I am sure we will be able to complete the work in time.”"

Experts will be available at the centre located at the pollution control board office here to explain how to submit proposals and projects online and get them approved by the PCB. Vivek Kumar Singh, forest secretary and PCB chairman, said approval from the PCB to establish and operate entrepreneurial units was mandatory. “For the convenience of industrialists, we have already created online facility for submitting applications and also for their fast disposal,” he said. Many small and medium entrepreneurs from small cities and suburbs are not very familiar with environmental laws and rules, he said. “They are not even aware that PCB clearance is mandatory. In many cases, people find it difficult to submit applications online. Many of them are not computer savvy. Often, they manage things at some cyber cafés, but need technical guidance from an expert,” he added. “At the kendra, such people will get all facilities and guidance. The Suvidha Kendra experts will even update applicants about issues raised by the PCB and help them get things cleared,” he said.

"BOER DENG Washington, Aug. 23: The Secret Service has warned that it will run out of money to pay its staff by the end of next month unless it receives more money because of the expense of protecting President Trump's well- travelled family. By April Trump, who on most weekends has travelled to one of his private properties, was on target to outspend in his first year in office the total spent on private travel by Barack Obama over eight years — about $ 97 million. At the present pace of expenditure, 1,100 employees of the Secret Service would not receive overtime pay because of caps on salaries set by Congress, Randolph Alles, the director of the agency, said. The Secret Service is protecting 42 people in Trump's administration, including 18 members of his family, compared with 31 under Obama. The strain on resources is due to "" an overall increase in operational tempo"", Alles said. "" Normally we are not this tapped out,"" he told USA Today . Trump began receiving Secret Service protection in November 2015, as a frontrunner in the Republican presidential primaries. His campaign featured frequent clashes between protesters and supporters, prompting agents to take measures to protect him. The workload has not let up since his inauguration in January. Trump's adult children logged thousands of miles in trips abroad to promote Trump- branded businesses, with agents in tow. Trips accompanying Trump's children to Aspen, Vancouver, Dubai and Uruguay cost the Secret Service $ 220,000, according to government records. Some of the cost is borne by local police. The Palm Beach sheriff ' s office spent an estimated $ 60,000 a day in overtime pay when Trump stayed at his Mar- a- Lago resort on weekends early in his term. Between January and June the President's wife, Melania, and their son, Barron, 11, lived at Trump Tower in New York. The city's police spent several million dollars to secure the residence, for which it was reimbursed by the federal government. The Secret Service also rented office space in the tower until the start of last month. THE TIMES, LONDON President Trump with his wife Melania and son Barron at Morristown, New Jersey. ( AFP)"

According to the statement issued by Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh's office, a complete ban has been issued on carrying of firearms until the situation normalises.    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The Chief Minister has also ordered withdrawal of 1000 police personnel from VVIP security for deployment on field duty to strengthen the security blanket in the state, said an official spokesperson. The Centre has sanctioned an additional 10 companies of paramilitary forces to maintain law and order in the state. A total of 85 central companies along with thousands of policemen on the ground will maintain a tight vigil, especially in the vulnerable areas of Moga, Bathinda, Sangrur, Barnala, Patiala and Ludhiana, the spokesperson added. The Chief Minister has asked the police officials to fan out across the sensitive districts to ensure that there is no disruption of the law and order in the state in view of the impending order. Security has been tightened along the state's borders with Haryana, as well as the connecting roads to prevent any incursions, the spokesperson stated. The Chief Minister has ordered senior officers to personally monitor the situation on the ground, with the DGP visiting the various sensitive districts to review the preparations ahead of the verdict in the sensitive case. He also ordered the DGP intelligence to ensure strict monitoring of social media and effectively thwart any attempts by rumour mongers to spread unrest.

"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday directed the ministry of home affairs (MHA) to release as much paramilitary forces as required for the state of Haryana ahead of the verdict on dera sacha sauda head, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in a rape case.  While issuing directions, division bench headed by Justice S S Saron asked the additional solicitor general of India, Satya Pal Jain to take up the matter with MHA and ensure deployment of troops forthwith.  Coming down heavily on the state of Haryana for allowing the gathering of such large number of dera followers at Panchkula, where the judgement would be pronounced on Friday, Justice Saron said that court would not hesitate to dismiss the state DGP, if situation turned volatile. Justice Saron also made it clear that court would also explore the possibility of deployment of army to control the situation.  The order has come in the wake of a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking directions to ensure adequate security arrangements especially in the district of Panchkula and surrounding areas in view of the pronouncement.  The petition, filed by Panchkula resident Ravinder Singh Dhull, has also sought directions for monitoring of the security arrangements by high court, as despite prohibitory orders under section 144 criminal procedure code (CrPc), more than 1.5 lakh people have already entered in district Panchkula as Wednesday.  The petitioner, who is also a practicing lawyer, has also attached the photographs of dera followers staying on the roads of Panchkula city and several circulars issued by the states of Punjab and Haryana highlighting the volatile situation because of gathering of dera followers. The circulars include the conversion of several places as jail and presence of offensive items inside dera.   Seeking urgent judicial intervention in the matter of grave public importance, petitioner has submitted that the states of Haryana and Punjab are facing immense and acute security threat due to expected pronouncement in the criminal trial of Ram Rahim on August 25.

"CHENNAI: Amid the Supreme Court’s decision to ask BCCI office-bearers to show cause for not implementing reform orders, which may lead to expulsion if replies are not satisfactory, there was a bit of a good news for the board. While asking the CoA to submit a redrafted Constitution for the BCCI in accordance with its earlier order, the court added that three points be left out.

One of these being the contentious one-state-one-vote proposal, it was received warmly by the board members, who had opposed this point vehemently. The court also said that the matter of taking away voting rights of Railways, Services and Universities should not be part of the new constitution, along with the Lodha panel recommendation reducing members of national selection committees from five to three.

The new constitution to be submitted in court on September 19 — when the three office-bearers have also been asked to appear — will not have these restrictions. Along with a few other points, the board had been fighting for these. So even if acting president CK Khanna, secretary Amitabh Chaudhary and treasurer Anirudh Choudhry get ready to answer tough questions, several BCCI members were breathing a sigh of relief.

“This is one of the major demands we had, as we thought that the one-state-one-vote policy would undermine the importance and contributions of units that have served the game for a long time,” said the head of a West Zone state, which would have been able to vote once in three years had the rule come in place. “If what the court has said means that this rule will not be implemented, this is good news.”

This proposal said that the associations of Gujarat, Baroda, Saurashtra (from Gujarat) and Mumbai, Maharashtra, Vidarbha (from Maharashtra) take turns in voting, one from each state every year. Almost the entire board opposed this, arguing that it devalues cricketing legacy. “We don’t have problems with Manipur, Mizoram voting. But there shouldn’t be a situation when they vote and Mumbai or Gujarat doesn’t. Thankfully, it’s been taken care of,” said the official.

During the hearing at Supreme Court on Wednesday, the BCCI counsel also raised other contentious points like a cooling-off period of three years between each term for office-bearers. Justice Dipak Misra did not reject or approve it, but said this will be heard on September 19. The BCCI members can take heart also from this, since the door is not closed on it either.

All in all, on a day the show-cause notices cast a shadow over the future of three office-bearers, there was consolation for BCCI. Considering that one-state-one-vote was a major issue, this is no small consolation either.

"CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister and his newly-appointed deputy continued their bonhomie on Wednesday even as sacked AIADMK deputy general secretary TTV Dhinakaran remained stedfast against the merger of party’s rival factions.

More bad news greeted Dinakaran camp after the Supreme Court dismissed review petition filed by Sasikala challenging the judgment holding her guilty in disproportionate assets case. V Pugalendi, TTV supporter, said, “We were expecting a favourable judgment. But we still have the option of a curative petition which we will use.” The judgment comes as a shot in the arm for the OPS camp that had raised a banner of revolt against Sasikala. In fact, it was OPS who revolted on February 7 at the Amma Memorial on Marina Beach, that plunged Tamil Nadu into political turmoil that took over six months to settle with the merger of the two AIADMK factions on Monday. But this was not be as Dinakaran opposed the merger as he was sidelined and efforts were made to oust his aunt Sasikala."
"Chief electoral officer of Andhra Pradesh Bhanwar Lal on Wednesday said there will be no delay in taking action against YSR Congress president Y S Jaganmohan Reddy for his derogatory remarks against chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu. Speaking to the media, Bhanwar Lal said the poll panel had strictly followed the procedure in receiving complaints, serving notice, receiving reply and finally taking action. He said the speech of Jaganmohan Reddy , which was in Telugu, had to be carefully translated into English and sent to the Election Commission for further action.

"China share indexes barely moved on Thursday morning, as profit-taking in China Unicom Network Communications Ltd cooled excitement about state enterprise reforms, though raw material stocks rebounded, aided by a weaker dollar.

Hong Kong shares, which resumed trading after a one-day closure for a strong typhoon, followed Asian markets higher, helped by solid gains in financial and consumer stocks.

The CSI300 index was down l 0.2 percent, to 3,750.19 points at the end of the morning and the Shanghai Composite Index was basically unchanged, at 3,286.42 points.

Risk appetites were reduced by a 4 percent pull-back in China Unicom, as some investors pocketed gains produced by the stock's spiking 10 percent on both Monday and Tuesday, before slipping 0.9 percent on Wednesday.

The surge was triggered by a planned restructuring that would see the listed telecom operator tap a dozen major investors, including Alibaba Group, Tencent Holdings and Baidu, for funds.

""State-owned enterprise restructuring remains an attractive investment theme, and we have been looking for the next company that will likely undergo restructuring,"" said Wu Kan, head of equity trading at Shanshan Finance.

The Ministry of Finance said on Thursday that profits at China's state-owned firms rose 23.1 percent in the first seven months of 2017 from a year earlier.

The Securities Times newspaper reported that the government has already selected SOEs to take part in a third round of its mixed ownership reform programme.

Wu said that the recent sharp correction in cyclical stocks could provide buying opportunities, if coming economic indicators point to continued recovery.

Raw material shares, which fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday, rebounded 0.6 percent. Some analysts say a weaker U.S. dollar would strengthen commodity prices, and thus benefit producers.

HONG KONG

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index added 0.6 percent, to 27,567.73 points, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index gained 1.2 percent, to 11,082.24.

The market drew support from other Asian markets that shook off the risk aversion that gripped financial markets overnight after President Donald Trump's threat to shut the U.S. government.

The financial subindex rose nearly 1 percent, while that for consumer stocks was up 0.8 percent.

Shares of Chinese developer Guangzhou R&F Properties Co Ltd jumped as much as 10 percent to their highest since July 2009, bolstered by strong earnings growth.

"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a condition that damages the lung airways causing symptoms such as chest tightness, breathlessness, wheezing and persistent cough. It is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the country, and accounts for five lakh deaths annually in India. A very significant aspect of COPD that affects almost 75 per cent of the patients, the night-time discomfort, is often overlooked by patients and goes unnoticed by clinicians.Dr PP Bose, a Delhi-based Pulmonologist explains, “Normally, our breathing changes during sleep due to general muscle relaxation that slightly increases airway resistance. In a healthy person, because of an overall relaxed state and lesser oxygen demand in the body, this slightly reduced pace is normal. But with people suffering from COPD, this change brings added challenge because the airflow in their lungs is already restricted.”  Immediate effects of night-time symptom include fatigue and low productivity, the long-term consequences involve lung function changes, increased exacerbation frequency, emergence or worsening of cardiovascular disease, cognitive effects, depression, impaired quality of life and increased mortality.In COPD, while in the morning, symptom includes an increase in phlegm and cough, at night it is wheezing, chest tightness, frequent nocturnal awakenings, difficulty falling back to sleep after an awakening and shortened sleep duration. Hence, an effective treatment regimen should consider both set of symptoms, says Dr R Vijaikumar, Pulmonologist, Apollo Hospital, Hyderabad.For this, while most COPD patients respond reasonably well to the pharmacological therapies (drugs that improve the passages of air into the lungs), in cases where such therapies are not effective enough to ensure a disturbance-free sleep, some form of assisted ventilation is recommended such as noninvasive ventilation (NIV) therapy.ANI"
"Civil supplies commissioner, C V Anand, on Wednesday warned wholesale dealers and traders from jacking up the prices of sugar. Anand said there were reports that some dealers were planning to hoard stocks of sugar and indulge in speculative price rise by creating artificial scarcity, in violation of rules. Mincing no words, the civil supplies commissioner made it clear to dealers at a meeting convened by him on Wednesday that licensed dealer and traders should not sell sugar at a price higher than the rate fixed by the Central or state government. He directed field officers to conduct regular raids to check if any of the traders are doing business without license or indulging in hoarding excess stocks. “A person engaged in the business of purchase, sale and storage for sale of sugar in quantities of five quintals or more is considered as sugar dealer,“ he said. Stating that wholesaler should get license from concerned district civil supplies officer or the local Tahasildar, the commissioner said if they fail to obtain license, action will be taken under civil supplies Act. The government has extended the notification which imposed stock holding and turnover limits on dealers of sugar till October 28, 2017. The Centre has also authorised the state governments and Union territories to enforce this order. Anand also discussed the regulations issued by Central government on sugar prices with the representatives of sugar dealers association."
"CM nudge prompts traffic police to keep backup plan ready, trial run on diversions from August 26 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT The Ranchi traffic department is readying an alternative route plan to divert vehicles during the construction of the long- pending Kantatoli flyover, the foundation stone for which is expected to be laid anytime soon. Sources said Vice- President Venkaiah Naidu was likely to lay the foundation stone when he comes to the capital to inaugurate the smart city project on September 9. However, officials in Jharkhand Urban Development Infrastructure Company ( JUDICO) said a formal date was yet to be confirmed. In a review meeting with the urban development department last month, chief minister Raghubar Das had directed officials to lay the foundation stone for the flyover by the end of this month. On Wednesday, a team comprising traffic SP Sanjay Ranjan Singh and other officials of the urban development department visited Bahu Bazar area to work on alternative routes. Singh said they had decided to hold the first trial on August 26. "" From Thursday, an antiencroachment drive will kick off in full throttle to clear routes on which vehicular movements will be diverted,"" he told The Telegraph. On August 26, traffic will be restricted on roads leading to Kantatoli as part of the first trial. "" We shall hold a second trial for two- three days and gradually make it permanent till the flyover is compelete. I think people will have to face some inconvenience for two years, but we shall try to do our best,"" Singh assured. Four roads fork out from Kantatoli Chowk — one goes towards Bahu Bazar and Doranda, another towards Kokar and Booty More, the third to Namkum and the fourth to Dangratoli and Lalpur. Singh said initially the restrictions would be imposed only on the Bahu Bazar and Kokar stretches. "" Vehicles coming from Doranda or the railway station, won't be allowed to go beyond the turning near Oxford School on Bahu Bazar Road. There is a left turn a few steps ahead of the school that can be used to approach Main Road, Dangratoli and other parts of the city. Alternatively, one can take a left turn from Bazu Bazar side on Karbala Chowk Road,"" he said. Vehicles coming from Booty More to Kantatoli will be stopped around 200 metres beyond Kokar Chowk. One will have to take a diversion from Kokar Road to reach one's destination. "" Depending on how things pan out, we shall improvise later,"" Singh said, adding that the detailed route maps will be released in a couple of days. JUDICO officials said the acquisition of around 20.277 decimals of government land and 450.38 decimals of private land was underway but the construction work was expected only after Durga Puja. The 1,250- metre flyover on Kantatoli- Booty Road is expected to cost around Rs 37 crore, they said. "" Modi Construction Company has bagged the tender for the flyover, which has to be completed within 24 months from the date of commencement of work,"" Alok Kumar Mandal, deputy GM of JUDICO, said.

"Come September, the Bharatiya Janata Party will once again court people of the state on the issue of celebrating the 17th of the month as Telangana Liberation Day . The BJP, gearing itself up to emerge as the sole viable alternative to the ruling TRS in the state, is expected to take the `help' of none other than chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao in this endeavour. The BJP has been demanding for sometime that the TRS government celebrate September 17 as Telangana Liberation day . It also says Chandrasekhar Rao, who promised during the election campaign in the run up to the 2014 elections that if the TRS is voted to power, Telangana Liberation Day will be celebrated, should keep his word. However, three years after formation of Telangana and with whispers of polls earlier than the scheduled year of 2019 only getting strident and the TRS government not making any moves on the matter, the BJP has once again decided to make the issue of Liberation Day one of the issues it will take to the people. “We will use the several vi deo clips and audio clips of Chandrasekhar Rao promising to celebrate the day as the true independence day for Telangana. The people can hear the chief minister in his own words and voice on the subject.And we will then explain how he failed to keep his promise,“said senior party functionary and BJP floor leader in the Legislative Assembly G Kishan Reddy . “At present, this is an issue on which we will hold the chief minister and TRS accountable. When elections roll around, the issue of Telangana Liberation Day will also become a part of our party campaign,“ Kishan Reddy told TOI. Video clips of Chandrasekhar Rao speaking about Telangana Liberation Day from the last poll campaign are already making the rounds on the social media, he said and added that the BJP will further push the message across this September. The BJP plans to launch a campaign from the ground level up from September 1 demanding Telangana Liberation Day celebrations. The campaign this year will culminate with a large public meeting in Hyderabad on September 17 to be addressed by Union home minister Rajnath Singh."

"Concerned over alleged theft of personal and financial data, the government is set to mandate strict security and privacy guidelines and standards for mobile handset makers. The cybersecurity standards may be announced in the next few weeks and are aimed at protecting data and information of mobile users.They will also look at controlling the movement of personal information of users to servers abroad, sources in the IT ministry told TOI. “This is a very serious matter and we will soon be issuing standards and guidelines that guard against any theft of information from mobile devices,“ one source said.The concern of the government stems from the fact that internet access in India is led by mobile devices, which have emerged as the main source of contact with the online world. “With digital transactions going on an overdrive after the government's efforts in this direction, the fear of hacking and siphoning of data has reached an alarming level,“ the source added. A large number of phones sold in the country are from Chinese companies or have their origins in the neighbouring country . The government feels that rising tensions with China may lead to a situation where critical data of individuals may be compromised, when procured illegally . The standards will be based on the recommendations of two high-level committees -one led by the RBI and other by the Department of Telecom (DoT). These will be in addition to the provisions in the IT Act that guard against any theft of data. The government fears that apart from financial and personal data, the information being accessed illegally may also include location of individuals, their medical records, and their browsing history .

"Consulting and auditing firm Deloitte is close to signing a lease deal for 1.5 million sq ft of office space in the city, according to people aware of the development. The company is negotiating with top commercial real estate builders and will finalise a deal soon, they said.“The space will be taken up in two phases and is in the request for proposal stage,“ one of the persons cited earlier said, adding that Deloitte will consolidate two of its campuses in Bengaluru into the new facility that will seat at least 1,500 employees.A spokesperson of Deloitte declined to confirm that the company is in talks to lease office space.Deloitte occupies over 800,000 sq ft of office space in Bengaluru. “Deloitte will be taking additional space in the new facility for future requirement as well,“ said another person aware of the transaction.Several top companies are looking for office space to consolidate their operations and prepare for growth as the economy improves.Experts say Bengaluru tops companies' list of citi es where they would like to set up office.Among the large lease deals in the city concluded recently are Amazon and Qualcomm, taking up 600,000 sq ft and 700,000 sq ft of office space in Bagmane Constellation Business Park, respectively, and TCS leasing 360,000 sq ft in Brigade Bhuwalka Icon. “Despite headwinds and cautious stance by IT-BPM occupiers, the IT-BPM sector continues to be the primary demand driver,“ said Anshul Jain, managing director for India at Cushman & Wakefield. “Limited availability of quality supply has encouraged occupiers to pre-commit office spaces, resulting in a significant increase of about three times in such activity, primarily driven by ITBPM and healthcare sectors in Hyderabad, Gurgaon and Bengaluru.“ According to Cushman & Wakefield, Bengaluru witnessed a total supply of 3.8 million sq ft of office space in H1 of 2017, while total net absorption stood at 3.3 million sq ft."
"Consumption, agriculture and government expenditure are likely to have helped the economy grow 6.5% year-on-year in the first quarter of the fiscal ended June, a tad higher than 6.1% in the trailing quarter. Private investment, however, is not likely to show much improvement in the first quarter growth numbers, according to economists. Most independent economists have forecast the gross domestic product (GDP) to grow in the range of 6.1-6.6% in the AprilJune quarter which is modest compared with the 7.9% growth registered in the year-ago period. The statistics office will release the first quarter figures on August 31. Among the most optimistic are HDFC and Fitch Group firm India Ratings that expect the GDP to have grown 6.6% in the quarter. Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist at India Ratings, said the growth would “be driven by a revival of consumption growth which was very low in the fourth quarter of FY17“. DK Joshi, chief economist at Crisil, said growth will get hit by the lingering impact of demonetisation, while the goods and services tax (GST) would have caused short-term disruptions to GDP in the first quarter. GST was rolled out on July 1, but its impact was evident from a month before when companies started adjusting production. Upasna Bhardwaj, economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank, said uncertainty linked with GST affected industrial recovery in the first half. “The data for corporate earnings is muted and we are getting mixed signals on the services side,“ she said. Axis Bank, too, was cautious in its forecast, predicting a 6.1% growth in the quarter due to lack of industrial revival. Industrial production, as measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), was up a modest 2% in April-June quarter. Ratings agency ICRA expects modest growth because of the disruption in production schedules and discounts offered ahead of the introduction of GST, impact of the appreciation of the rupee visà-vis the dollar on export earnings, and issues related to sectors such as banking and telecom.These would off set the impact of upfronting the government's expenditure and a healthy rabi harvest of several crops. Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA, has forecast GDP to rise 6.1% in the first quarter, higher than the growth of gross value added (GVA) due to a sharp increase in the government's subsidies. GDP is GVA plus indirect taxes minus subsidies. Madan Sabnavis of CARE Ratings expects GDP to grow 6.5% in the Ju ne quarter due to subdued industrial production led by GST but propped by government expenditure and agriculture. Experts expect the remaining quarters of the fiscal to be better, aided by remonetisation and improved financial conditions.“This is an atypical quarter and we don't expect this trend to continue the entire year,“ said Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist at Axis Bank. Nomura expects only a modest recovery in GDP at 6.6% but it has projected growth to accelerate sharply to 7.4% in the second half of 2017. Economic activity in the country , which had lost some momentum in the run up to the GST rollout, has started to recover, it said in its report. Pant of India Ratings said: “While GVA is likely to be affected by inventory depletion at stickiest end, GDP is likely to get a boost from advanced consumption expenditure of cars and other white goods.“ Recently released second instalment of Economic Survey for FY17 said there was lower probability of growth reaching higher end of 6.75%-7.5% forecast for FY18."
"CR Gharekhan

In his address to US troops, Donald Trump pitched for a deeper US involvement in Afghanistan, a military campaign he once slammed as futile. His policy is a conditions-based regional move towards a political solution & a strategic partnership with India is a “critical” part of it.

CR Gharekhan

President Trump revealed his long-awaited strategy for Afghanistan in a prime time speech on national television on August 21. He called it ""the path forward in Afghanistan and South Asia"", the first President to so describe it. The timing of the speech was selected, at least partly, to divert attention from the widespread criticism, including by senior leaders from his own party as well as from top business magnates, for his remarks on the Charlotsville happenings. He might have succeeded to some extent in this objective. In outlining his approach, he took a 180-degree turn and departed from his long-held and oft-repeated position demanding immediate withdrawal from Afghanistan. He was conscious of that and had the political courage to reverse his stand by not only not deciding to pull out but even announcing an increase in US troop strength. He was conscious of the American people's strong aversion to sending more troops in harm's way in faraway Afghanistan. He ignored the advice of Steve Bannon, the ultra conservative and his chief strategic adviser until last week when Bannon was pushed out. He did not mention any figures, though the number 4,000 has been talked. He declared an open-ended commitment, regarding numbers and the time period for troops to remain in Afghanistan. He specifically criticised Barack Obama's unwise decision to announce the withdrawal date and to reduce the request for additional troops by 25 per cent —30,000 instead of 40,000. Trump has embraced the military's advice of making the continued stay of troops ""conditions-based"", instead of time-based. Before Obama’s speech at West Point, there was intense debate about ""time bound"" versus ""condtions based"", but he made a grave error by taking the time-bound approach. Trump also criticised Obama for pulling out of Iraq in 2011, leaving a vacuum which was exploited by the Islamic State. However, Obama had very little choice in the matter since the Iraqi government and Parliament refused to sign the “Status of Forces Agreement” which was a must for the administration to station troops in a foreign country on a long-time basis. In addition to the ""conditions-based"" approach, Trump assured the military that it will have the resources and operational freedom, including deciding on the rules of engagement, to make the new strategy ""work, and work effectively, and work quickly"". This is somewhat on the lines of the Modi government's carte blanche to the Army to use whatever force is deemed essential to deal with cross-border terrorist attacks. In both cases, time alone will tell if and to what extent the desired result will ensue. Trump made it abundantly clear that his strategy demanded identifiable and effective action by the Afghan government. The heaviest burden will be borne by the ""good people"" of Afghanistan and their armed forces. Categorically ruling out ""democracy building"" or ""nation building"", he made it clear that ""our commitment is not unlimited and our support is not a blank check.” He demanded that the Afghan government must carry its share of the military, political and economic burden. He made no mention of the other players — China, Russia and Iran. These three countries have their own strategic interests in Afghanistan, not coinciding with America's. But they have conflicting concerns. On the one hand, they would be quite happy if America remains bogged down in Afghanistan, bleeding resources. At the same time, they would like to see America pull out completely which would leave the field clear for them to meddle more effectively in Afghanistan. All the three are reportedly in touch with, and even aiding, the Taliban. For us, Trump's remarks on Pakistan and India are of obvious importance. A strong pillar of the new strategy, he declared, is to change the approach towards Pakistan. “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens to terrorist organisations”. Pakistan “has much to gain by partnering American efforts in Afghanistan” and much to lose by ""continuing to harbour criminals and terrorists"". He did not specify what he would do if Pakistan did not cooperate, but hinted at a cut in economic aid when he stated: ""We have been paying billions and billions of dollars at the same time they have been housing the very terrorists we have been fighting"". This is an unmistaken reference to the earlier refuge to Osama bin Laden and sanctuary to the Haqqani terror network. “That will have to change and change immediately”, he said. ""It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order and peace"". Strong words pleasing to Indian ears. One will have to wait and see how much, if at all, Trump's warning will bring a change in Pakistan's Afghan policy. Trump's speech also brings out, unambiguously, that the success of his new strategy will depend to a large extent on Pakistan's cooperation. This will give considerable leverage to Pakistan that can always depend on the Pentagon which has consistently had a soft corner for the Pakistan army and decides US policy in Afghanistan, like its Pakistani counterpart. Trump has made positive references to India, ""the world's largest democracy and a key security and economic partner of United States"". Developing a strategic partnership with India will be a 'critical' part of the new South Asia strategy. True to his style, he pointed out that India ""makes billions of dollars in trade with United States"", and must do more in Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development. Clearly hinting at China, the President spoke of ""our shared objectives for peace and security in South Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region"". We need not get too flattered by Trump's remarks about India; he will demand a price for all that India seeks from the US in terms of technology transfers and that is as it should be. We will have to carefully calculate how much money to spend in Afghanistan, in addition to the $2 billion already invested. In all fairness, our help has generated friendly feelings among the Afghan people for India. We have huge interest in ensuring that the Taliban does not come to power either by themselves or as a part of a coalition for which Pakistan has been working for long. We do not want hordes of Taliban descending on Kashmir. But it is highly doubtful if Trump's so-called new Afghanistan South Asia strategy — shades of Af-Pak-India of Holbrooke's original mandate? — will prevent, and for how long, the Taliban getting at least a share in power in Kabul."
"Days of dengue dread ahead SUBHAJOY ROY Aug. 23: Bengal is approaching its potential dengue flashpoint less prepared than it should be to combat a repeat of last year, when the number of cases had trebled in three months. Data available with the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme shows that 6,900- odd dengue cases were reported in 2016 till August. The figure soared to 22,865 between September and November. "" This time, the incidence of dengue in Bengal is less compared to the first half of the season last year. But the period between July and October is when the maximum number of dengue infections occur. Surveillance and preventive measures determine how you get through this phase,"" P. K. Sen, director of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, told Metro . Amitabha Nandy, director of the Centre for Studies on Infection and Immunity, identified the abundance of stagnant rainwater during the monsoon as the primary threat to public health at this time of the year. "" Mosquitoes need freshwater to breed and monsoon provides that. The key to combating dengue is by preventing mosquitoes from breeding rapidly during the rainy season,"" he said. So where does Calcutta stand in terms of preparedness for the period when dengue is endemic? Residents of several localities said vector- control teams deployed by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation ( CMC) had been visiting their areas once in a fortnight. In a few instances, the gap between visits is 10 days. The recommended dengue- prevention protocol is a repeat field visit every seven days. The Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the dengue virus can breed in a spoonful of water. Since the larva develops into an adult in a week, maintaining the larvicide cycle is crucial to destroying the source of the disease. "" It is not always possible to revisit a place within seven days because we have a manpower shortage. The vigil is unlikely to increase,"" said an official in the civic body's health department. The CMC has cancelled even sanctioned leave for its health workers from August 1. Additional manpower has been provided to large wards and areas where dengue has been reported. Till last week, 571 dengue cases were reported in Bengal, according to the website of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. A little over 100 of these patients are in Calcutta.

Jalandhar, August 23

A 23-year-old woman from Vadela Granthia village (Batala) was allegedly stalked near the bus stand here on Saturday, following which her friend clashed with a group of youths called by her suspected stalker. The victim’s father alleged that the cops illegally confined her in the lock-up for two nights in connection with the incident, even though her name does not figure in the FIR, and made her sign 10 blank papers. Her lawyer, Vimal Sachdeva, said: “She was called by her friend Gurjant Singh’s mother to the police station, but the cops arrested her.” Gurjant and others were booked under Sections 307 and 160 of the IPC. The blank papers were mistakenly attached with the police file presented before duty magistrate Puneet Mohinia, who suspected that the victim was being wrongly implicated. She was then brought to the court on production warrant. Her statement was recorded in-camera. The victim’s father said the stalker belonged to their village. “He has been after my daughter for a long time. He was travelling on the same bus to Jalandhar. His relative is posted in the bus stand police post,” he added. “On Sunday, we apprised Police Commissioner PK Sinha of the incident, but no action was taken,” he said. Sinha said, “As per our report, no stalking took place. The woman was accompanying her ex-boyfriend. She fled the spot with the assailants. On her confinement, I have to check the timings of her arrest and the follow-up action. An inquiry is on into the signatures on blank papers.”"

"Despite the adverse effects of demonetisation and three successive years of drought, Karnataka has retained the top spot in attracting industrial investments. From January 2016 to June 2017, the state has received investment proposals of Rs 1,54,173 crore. “We have also received fresh investment proposals worth Rs 6,113.29 crore in the last few months involving some major companies,'' industries minister R V Deshpande told reporters on Wednesday , quoting figures from the department of industrial policy and promotion. Deshpande said 15 major companies are making fresh investments in Karnataka.These include Oracle India that has proposed to invest Rs 2,438 crore to expand its unit in the ITITES Special Economic Zone (Bengaluru), a project expected to generate 9,697 jobs. Wipro Enterprises has proposed to invest nearly Rs 112 crore in the Aerospace SEZ in Devanahalli, and TVS Motors has proposed to invest Rs 1,110 crore to expand its plant at Kadakola in Mysuru that will generate 800 jobs. “We have already cleared these major investments,'' the minister said.

"Dubai, Aug. 23 ( AP): The Saudi police arrested a 14- year- old boy who was filmed dancing to the Macarena at an intersection in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, according to local media reports today. The video, which went viral on social media ins the kingdom, shows the boy with head phones and wearing grey sweat shorts, a striped T- shirt and neon green and yellow Crocs on his feet. He is swaying his hips and arms to the 90s hit song, appearing to be smiling and giggling throughout the dance. The state- linked Sabq news website quoted Col. Aati bin Attiyah al- Qurashi as saying police arrested the young man yesterday and were preparing to refer him to prosecutors for disrupting traffic and improper public behaviour. Western music and dancing is taboo in Saudi Arabia, but such incidents in the past have not necessarily led to lengthy imprisonment or serious punishment. The young man may be asked to sign a police form vowing to not disrupt traffic again. Traditional dance, however, is permitted. Saudi King Salman and President Donald Trump were filmed taking part in a traditional all- male Saudi sword dance in May when the President visited the kingdom to boost ties. Saudi Arabia's young heir to the throne, 31- year- old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has pushed for greater openings for entertainment in the kingdom, including allowing a limited number of musical concerts after a more than a 20- yearban. He has also encouraged young Saudis to become more physically active as part of a wide- reaching reform agenda that includes raising life expectancy in the country. Diplomatic visits Iran and Saudi Arabia will exchange diplomatic visits soon, Tehran said today, indicating a possible thaw in relations between the regional rivals since they severed diplomatic ties last year. Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told the Iranian Students' News Agency ( ISNA) that the visits could take place after the Haj pilgrimage ends in the first week of September. "" The visas have been issued for both sides to make this trip,"" Zarif said, according to ISNA. "" We are waiting for the final steps to be completed so diplomats from the two countries can inspect their embassies."" Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia are at their worst in years, with each accusing the other of subverting regional security and supporting opposite sides in conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran in January 2016."

"England: Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp voiced hope that guiding his team back into the Champions League will strengthen his hand in transfer talks over the last week of the trading window.

Liverpool secured a place in the group stage for only the second time since 2010 after a 4-2 home win over Hoffenheim on Wednesday completed a 6-3 aggregate victory in the play-off round.

Klopp has only managed to bring in Mohamed Salah, Andy Robertson and Dominic Solanke in the transfer window so far and he suggested that number might increase now Liverpool are back among the elite.

""It`s a big influence on the transfer market, especially if you do it more often,"" Klopp told reporters at Anfield.

""If you talk to a player, especially the players we talk to -- because we don`t talk to players that are not better than our players -- they say, `If you played in the Champions League, it would be really interesting because the club is great, the manager`s not too bad` -- all this stuff.

""Or even when you try to extend a contract with a player in the squad. They say, `Yeah, I want to play Champions League.`

""I always think, `WTF? It`s your job to do it with us together! Don`t ask for us to do the job so you can play Champions League. Do it with us together.`

""And that`s what this team did. That`s why I`m so happy about it. Fourteen months` hard work. And we did it. Nice.""

Appointed in October 2015, Klopp was unable to steer Liverpool into the Champions League in his first season as they finished eighth in the Premier League, but a fourth-place finish last term opened the door to a return.

They will discover their group-stage opponents in Thursday`s draw in Monaco and Klopp could not contain his excitement at the thought of the Champions League music booming out over Anfield again.

""It`s so exciting to be part of it,"" said the German, who led former club Borussia Dortmund to the competition final in 2013.

""For me personally, it`s two or three years ago (since his last involvement). I loved it always.

""I still love it, the players love it, the crowd loves it. We will have a few fantastic European nights at Anfield. So all good in the moment and nothing to moan about.""Leading 2-1 from the first leg, Liverpool flew out of the blocks, scoring three times in the opening 21 minutes through an Emre Can brace and a Salah effort.

""The start of the game was like a thunderstorm,"" Klopp said.

Klopp hailed Can for overcoming the effects of illness to play and reserved special praise for Roberto Firmino, who created Can`s second goal and scored Liverpool`s fourth against his former club.

""Roberto Firmino!"" Klopp exclaimed in his post-match press conference. ""What a game he had today.""

Klopp said he had ""nothing to say"" about Philippe Coutinho, who continues to be courted by Barcelona and was absent against Hoffenheim due to illness and a back problem. Liverpool insist he will not be sold.

Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann, who is only 30, delivered a critical assessment of his team`s display, saying they had played like ""headless chickens"".

Hoffenheim are playing in Europe for the first time in their history and will now drop into the Europa League.

""This is a disappointment that will last for a bit, of course,"" said Nagelsmann, whose side scored through substitute Mark Uth and Sandro Wagner.

""We need to develop and be better than we played today. It doesn`t help thinking about a past game. You can`t change anything now.

""We should use the Europa League as an opportunity to become more mature, to develop and hopefully we`ll meet teams that will help us to do that.

""We`re going to tackle the Europa League and we look forward to competing on an international level."""

more-in

Curtly Ambrose was scathing about the West Indies' “totally embarrassing” defeat by England inside three days during last week's first Test at Edgbaston.

But as the three-match series heads to Headingley, where the second Test starts on Friday, it is a reminder the former fast bowler was in a West Indies side beaten inside two days by England at the Leeds ground 17 years ago.

In 2000, the teams started the fourth Test of a five-match series at Yorkshire's headquarters all square at 1-1.

Whereas England victories over the men from the Caribbean have now become commonplace — 2000 was the last time the West Indies won a Test on English soil — it was a very different story at the turn of the century.

Prior to the 2000 campaign, which England eventually took 3-1, you had to go back to 1969 for the last time England won a Test series against the West Indies.

If the team of 17 years ago was not as menacing as the one that inflicted successive 'blackwashes' on England in the mid-1980s, it still had players of the calibre of Ambrose, fellow fast bowler Courtney Walsh and star batsman Brian Lara.

And yet England managed to produce the first two-day Test win by any side for 54 years — and England's first since hammering South Africa at Old Trafford in 1912.

What made it even sweeter for the Headingley faithful, who will hope it is an omen for an England team now captained by Yorkshire's Joe Root and featuring county colleague Jonny Bairstow, was that several local heroes played key roles in a stunning victory.

Yorkshire all-rounder Craig White took his maiden Test 'five for' in West Indies' first innings 172.

Hard Test cricket

County colleague Michael Vaughan, the future England captain, made his then Test-best score of 76 in a reply of 272.

England were indebted to another Yorkshireman in Darren Gough for sparking a slump that saw the West Indies bowled out for just 61 in 26.2 overs -- a second-innings slide that makes last week's twin collapses in Birmingham look almost tame by comparison.

The fast bowler had Adrian Griffith and Wavell Hinds both out first ball. Their fellow left-hander Lara survived the hat-trick but fell in Gough's next over, lbw without playing a shot for the second time in the match.

Andrew Caddick rounded things off with a remarkable spell of five for five in 15 balls, including four wickets in an over, after the Somerset paceman was switched to the Football Stand End (as both fans of Yorkshire and the adjoining Leeds rugby football league club have long called it).

Ridley Jacobs was lbw to the first ball before Caddick shattered the stumps of Nixon McLean, Ambrose and Reon King in four legitimate deliveries.

Another eight balls and Caddick had finished the job, bowling Walsh to give England victory by an innings and 39 runs.

Much has changed in the intervening 17 years — for example the players and press at Headingley have moved from the Football Stand to the Carnegie Pavilion — barely a glint in an architect's eye in 2000 -- at the opposite Kirkstall Lane End.

And yet the post-match comments of West Indies captain Jimmy Adams, now their director of cricket, could, rather worryingly, just as easily have come from current coach Stuart Law.

""We have the fellows who can do the job,"" said senior batsman Adams.

""But a lot of our players are starting their careers and are finding out just how hard Test cricket can be."""
"Even as Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd threatens to upend the Indian telecom market with disruptive moves, its contribution to the government exchequer in terms of licence fee and spectrum usage charges continues to be negligible.

It has paid Rs 47.81 crore to the government as licence fee and spectrum usage charge in the six months ended June, according to data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).

That compares with the Rs 2,902.75 crore paid by Bharti Airtel Ltd; Rs 2,005.25 crore by Vodafone India Ltd; and Rs 1,677.67 crore by Idea Cellular Ltd.

Telcos pay roughly 8% of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) as licence fee and an additional 3% as spectrum usage charges, which are the two key avenues of government earnings from the telecom industry.

“There were no earnings in the March quarter as services were free to the customers. Then, started the transition towards paid services, which started to generate revenues. Also, if you have noticed, Jio’s AGR is in the negative and till the time it is negative, they will only pay fixed amount to the government,” a person familiar with Jio’s plans said, requesting anonymity.

The situation should improve from this quarter, the person said.

“The reason why they are showing negative AGR is because of the high number of outgoing calls from their network for which they are paying 14 paise IUC (interconnect usage charge). Therefore, licence fee and spectrum charges are paid on AGR and if AGR is negative, they will pay at minimum level,” a second person from the industry said, also requesting anonymity.

Jio did not respond to an email seeking comments.

Indian telecom companies are in the middle of a fierce battle to protect their turf after the entry of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio, which has disrupted the market and turned the tide in favour of data through free offers in the beginning and later with ultra-cheap mobile phones that went on sale in the beginning of March.

Telecom companies have repeatedly complained against Jio’s free offers since its launch in September.

Jio initially offered free voice calls and data until the end of 2016 in a promotional offer. The company later extended the offers to 31 March and further to June-end, which has now been rolled back.

Disruption caused by Jio has wiped off significant revenues of telcos, including that of market leader Bharti Airtel. Idea Cellular reported a loss in June quarter. Idea is now merging with Vodafone India to become the country’s largest telecom service provider.

Revenues of telcos will decline further by as much as 6% in 2017-18, according to Icra.

The fall in revenue will be led by a sharper decline in revenues for smaller operators such as Tata Teleservices Ltd, Aircel Ltd and Reliance Communications Ltd."

"F irst up, let me say, I hate the rains. Not the rains in Mumbai because it turns everything grey and depressing — I hate the rains, period. As a child, my parents wondered why I would get mayoos on certain days. Then they figured it out. A cloud in the sky and my mood would begin to change. Rain, and my face would be longer than a queue for alcohol in a village liquor shop on a holiday eve. So how have I survived the rains for the last 8 9 years in a city that basically has the celestial tap opened above it in 5 une and turned off in October? Simple. Rugby. For reasons that have to do with the availability of grounds in Mumbai, rugby here is played in the rains. There’s nothing like pain, mud, blood and broken bones to take your mind off the depressing effects of the monsoon. Having said that, like any Mumbaiite, I have my share of monsoon memories — some happy, some gloomy, but all of them quintessentially Mumbai. M y first memories go back to slushing miserably to the school bus stop in raincoat and gum boots ( do they call them that anymore?), hoping there’d be a magical call from the school office, cancelling school that day. Rain holidays! How we used to yearn for them! Sometimes, the school bus would be delayed and like prison escapees, we’d turn around very slowly and start walking home, hoping we wouldn’t hear the bus’ horn. The more distance we put between the bus stop and ourselves, the faster we’d walk, and just when we would break into a trot, we’d hear the dreaded sound of the triumphant horn reeling us in like prized catch. But, there were pleasant memories too. Running from school ( Flora Fountain) to home ( Napean Sea Road) in the rain, perfect long distance training for the annual cross country race. 5 ogging down Marine Drive, getting drenched by waves so high sometimes they missed you altogether and hit the road instead. Every birthday spent trekking through Borivali National Park in the rains ( yup, it’s divine sadism that my birthday falls squarely in the middle of the monsoon), followed by a picnic lunch of parathas, aloo dum and sookha mutton. Food never tastes as good as when you are cold and drenched, sitting on a rock next to a mini waterfall in the forest. Watching Woody Allen movies at home with my girlfriend, the rain outside strumming in harmony with our hormones. Our gang of boys walking aimlessly on a soaked Sunday evening, stopping every kilometre to eat — bhel puri at Chandralok near home, frankies at Scandal Point, sandwiches on Altamount Road and pani puri near Activity High School on Pedder Road. Watching the dahi- handi at Nana Chowk being broken during Govinda. Rehearsing for Are There Tigers In The Congo? with Rajit Kapur and on terribly rainy days, spending the night at director Rahul da- Cunha’s place. Suicidally cycling down a rain- drenched hillside in Lonavla for English, August — those screams are for real. B ut, for all my animus towards the rains, I could not imagine this city without them. Every piece of music has its swells and downturns, and for every me who thinks the rains are a downturn, there at least nine Mumbaiites for whom this is the climax of the year, the time that marks the uniqueness of this city. Put that way, even I tend to agree. Send your feedback to mailbag@ mid- day. com The views expressed in this column are the individual’s and don’t represent those of the paper"
"Facebook use in the US will slow as teens and young adults opt for Instagram and Snapchat, according to an eMarketer forecast released on Tuesday. The market tracker said Facebook’s online community will grow mainly due to increased adoption by older folks.“We see teens and tweens migrating to Snapchat and Instagram,” said eMarketer senior forecasting analyst Oscar Orozco. “Both have found success with this demographic since they are aligned with how they communicate  that is, visual content.”And while there are ‘Facebook-nevers’  children entering teenage years without engaging on the social network  Facebook owns Instagram so is still making connections with the demographic, according to the analyst.

"Faced with a shortage of doctors and nurses described as “desperate”, Britain’s health officials have launched an international drive to recruit at least 2,000 general practitioners over the next three years – India is among the countries being looked at.

The highest number of doctors who gained medical qualifications outside the United Kingdom is from India - 25,342, or 9% currently working in the NHS."
"Faced with an acute shortage of cops, the Haryana police department will find it difficult to maintain the law and order situation in the wake of the upcoming verdict in the Dera Sacha Sauda chief rape trial case

The department has failed to fill vacant posts despite having faced law and order problems several times in the past few years. Whenever faced with shortage of staff, the state government largely depends on paramilitary forces to maintain law and order in case of emergency as there are not enough police personnel in the districts.

Sources said the state police department has a total sanctioned strength of about 62,000 personnel, including the armed police, but it has only 42,000 personnel on its roll. Figures reveal that most of the districts have only 1,100- 1,400 cops against the requirement of about 3,000. The number of policewomen in most of the districts is around 50.

To maintain law and order, the government has allowed the district police to appoint home guards jawans and special police officers. Sources said Kaithal district has only 1,100 cops, 1,200 each in Kurukshetra and Yamunanagar and 1,500 in chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s constituency Karnal.

Even a major district like Gurgaon is facing a shortage of about 900 cops, raising questions over the safety and security of people, especially women, as women personnel comprise only 6.35% share in the state police.

In Rohtak district, which was the epicentre of the Jat agitation last year in which 31 people died and public and private properties of several crores were set afire, about 1,000 posts of cops are vacant.

“The state police is short of about 15,000 cops. Every district needs to hire about 1,000 cops to deal with any emerging law and order situation.”

To bridge the gap, the state government had started the recruitment of constables this year and even changed the recruitment by revising the minimum height eligibility for males in general category from 172cm to 170cm. For males in reserved categories, the minimum height was reduced from 169cm to 168cm. Minimum height was also reduced for women.

“The state police is short of about 15,000 cops. Every district needs to hire about 1,000 cops to deal with any emerging law and order situation,” said a senior police officer requesting anonymity. State director general of police (DGP) BS Sandhu could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. During his visit to Karnal in May, he had admitted shortage of manpower in the department.

According to the ministry of home affairs the Haryana police had received ₹54 crore in the past three years."

"FILE PHOTO - A general view shows delegates raising their hands as they take a vote at the closing session of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing November 14, 2012.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Late last month, executives from more than a dozen top European companies in China met in Beijing to discuss their concerns about the growing role of the ruling Communist Party in the local operations of foreign firms, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions.

President Xi Jinping's efforts to strengthen the party's role throughout Chinese society have reached the China operations of foreign companies, and executives at some of those entities don't like the resulting demands they are facing.

The presence of party units has long been a fact of doing business in China, where party organizations exist in nearly 70 percent of some 1.86 million privately owned companies, the official China Daily reported last month.

Companies in China, including foreign firms, are required by law to establish a party organization, a rule that had long been regarded by many executives as more symbolic than anything to worry about.

One senior executive whose company was represented at the meeting told Reuters some companies were under ""political pressure"" to revise the terms of their joint ventures with state-owned partners to allow the party final say over business operations and investment decisions.

He said the company's joint venture partner was pushing to amend their agreement to include language mandating party personnel be ""brought into the business management organization"", that ""party organization overhead expenses shall be included in the company budget"", and that posts of board chairman and party secretary be held by the same person.Changing joint venture agreement terms is the main concern, the executive said, noting that his company had thus far resisted.

""Once it is part of the governance, they have direct rights,"" he said.

The State Council Information Office (SCIO), which doubles as the party spokesman's office, told Reuters in a faxed statement that there is no interference by party organizations in the normal operating activity of joint venture or foreign-invested companies.

However, it added, ""company party organizations generally carry out activities that revolve around operations management, can help companies promptly understand relevant national guiding principles and policies, coordinate all parties’ interests, resolve internal disputes, introduce and develop talent, guide the corporate culture, and build harmonious labor relations.""

""They are widely welcomed within companies,"" the SCIO said. MAJOR DECISIONS

Of the 13 executives, all from different foreign companies, Reuters interviewed for this story, 8 expressed concerns about increasing demands from the party or noted increased activity from party groups. They all spoke on the condition that they and their companies not be identified given the sensitivity of discussing relations with the party.

Just two of 20 major multinationals queried by Reuters - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and Nokia NOKA.HE - confirmed having party units in their China operations. Most did not respond to questions on the subject. Only German chemicals giant Bayer AG acknowledged participating in the meeting organized by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, but declined to comment on what was discussed.

Carl Hayward, general manager and director of communications at the European Chamber's Beijing chapter, acknowledged the meeting was held to ""understand from our members if party structures are being formally introduced into the governance of joint ventures.""

""We have not noted any formal change of policy that reflects this. This is as we would expect since such a change would act as a deterrent to foreign investment in China,"" he said.

""REAL MUSCLE""

Under Xi, the party has sought to address the ""weakening, watering down, hollowing out and marginalisation"" of party leadership at state enterprises, the party's official People's Daily wrote in June. The paper cited an official with state-owned oil giant Sinopec as saying the company had demanded all its foreign joint venture partners ""specify the requirement for party-building work"" in their articles of association.

While plans to expand party organizations in foreign companies have been a quiet concern for several decades, only under Xi has ""some real muscle"" been put behind the goal, said Jude Blanchette, who studies the party at The Conference Board's China Center for Economics and Business in Beijing.

A significant number of major foreign companies operate in China through joint ventures with state enterprises. Foreign business groups have complained that their members are forced to allow Chinese partners access to their technology or risk losing market access.

Many Chinese state enterprises listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange have this year altered their articles of association to give an explicit role to internal party committees.

One country head at a major European manufacturer with a southern China joint venture said that late last year it allowed a party unit to meet on company premises – after hours. The party unit asked for overtime pay to hold the meeting, which the company rebuffed. But then it also demanded the company hire more party members, and even tried to weigh in on investment decisions.

""That's when we said this is a no-go zone. We didn't anticipate that they would discuss investment decisions,"" the manager told Reuters.

A sales and marketing head in China for a major U.S. consumer goods firm said its party cell had recently become more active, and had pushed for locating a new facility in a district where the local government was promoting investment, a move the company made.

Still, several executives with foreign companies in China said that the role of party units was benign and could help to resolve issues with officials. A party member at a U.S.-based Fortune 500 company in Shanghai said her firm's unit was not involved in business matters and instead engaged in activities such as planting trees and sponsoring children. ""They will give you some tickets to see movies together. When the State Council has a meeting and there's some news they will send bullet points by email,"" she said."
"FILE PHOTO - Samsung Group chief, Jay Y. Lee, is surrounded by media as he arrives at the Seoul Central District Court in Seoul, South Korea, January 18, 2017.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Group, South Korea's leading conglomerate, has no 'Plan B' for taking big decisions if its billionaire de facto leader Jay Y. Lee is jailed for corruption, people familiar with the matter said.

Lee, 49, has been in detention since February, on trial for charges ranging from embezzlement to perjury in a scandal that prompted the ouster of the country's ex-president Park Geun-hye.

He denies wrongdoing, and a lower court will give its verdict on Friday, with prosecutors demanding a 12-year jail term. He would likely appeal any conviction.

Facing a possible leadership vacuum, Samsung Group - whose businesses range from the world's leading smartphone and chip maker to hotels and insurance - has no plans to set up a leadership committee or a new executive role to drive strategy and take key decisions.

That could be a risk as some of the sprawling conglomerate's weaker businesses go through a turnaround plan or look for fresh growth drivers.

""There's no one right now who'll decide on group-wide issues,"" said a person with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. ""It's not impossible to imagine a scenario where a Samsung affiliate gets into trouble and other units become entangled.""

Previously, Samsung would have resorted to its powerful Corporate Strategy Office - dubbed the control tower - that oversaw the group, orchestrated the big decisions on asset sales or arranged support for weakened affiliates.

But Samsung disbanded that office in February after it was criticized for its role in the graft scandal. It also suspended its weekly ""Wednesday CEO meetings"" of affiliate firms, leaving no centralised coordination. And Choi Gee-sung, Lee's mentor and head of the control tower, stepped down.

""I think Samsung faces major challenges in efficiently managing the entire group ... it will struggle for a while to re-establish a strategic decision making process,"" Kim Sang-jo, South Korea's new antitrust chief, told Reuters.

In a statement in response to Reuters queries, Samsung said: ""The Corporate Strategy Office's role was to support affiliates and coordinate with them, including mediating overlapping businesses and (their) different interests, but the final business decision was made by each company.""

It noted the group had already announced that management at each affiliate would be led independently by their respective CEOs and boards.

""RATHER DISCONCERTING""

While Lee's detention appears to have had little impact at Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) - though its share price has dropped 9 percent from a record high in the past month - there are signs that future prospects for some businesses are being impacted.

South Korea's financial regulators this month cited the Lee trial when it delayed a review on Samsung Securities' (016360.KS) request to be allowed to sell short-term investment products - a key plank in the company's growth plan to expand its investment banking services.

""The current situation is rather disconcerting,"" said a spokeswoman for Samsung Securities.

Since group patriarch Lee Kun-hee was hospitalised following a heart attack in 2014, his son Jay Y. has led a restructuring - shedding non-core assets, mulling a capital injection for struggling Samsung Engineering (028050.KS), and creating a de facto holding company that tightened his grip.

The process has stalled this year with his detention - he said at his trial that he spends more than 90 percent of his time running Samsung Electronics.

Samsung insiders say the group is unlikely - if Lee goes to jail - to follow the example of SK, a telecoms-to-energy conglomerate, which relied on a ""Supex"" group leadership committee when its chairman Chey Tae-won was jailed. That group led CEO-level reshuffles in 2013-15 until Chey returned after a presidential pardon.

""I don't think (such) a management committee is likely. It would look as though the Corporate Strategy Office has returned, just after it was disbanded,"" one Samsung affiliate official said.

And nor is Lee Boo-jin, CEO of affiliate Hotel Shilla Co Ltd (008770.KS), expected to step up to fill her brother's role at Samsung Electronics or group-wide, people with knowledge of the matter said.

""The business division between the heirs is rather set,"" said an official at another Samsung affiliate. ""The pre-set flow of reporting up and decision-making will not change easily,"" the person added, noting Lee Boo-jin's focus on hotel and duty-free operations and Jay Y. Lee's control of technology units.

SLOW MOVING

For some investors, the worry is that any extended absence of Lee could slow decision making and delay moves that are needed to secure future growth.

Samsung Electronics, for example, announced six M&A deals last year, including buying Harman, a U.S. maker of connected car and audio systems, for $8 billion.

This year, there have been none.

""A big strategic change under Jay Y. Lee was to strengthen Samsung Electronics' B2B (business-to-business) portfolio besides semiconductors,"" said Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score.

""They were in the long-term process of changing all divisions into B2B, when Lee was detained. This could throw a spanner in its macro direction, and make it more difficult to decide on large-scale M&A.""

A Seoul-based fund manager, who has invested in Samsung affiliates, said all Samsung businesses would be able to carry out their operations as usual, ""but large M&A deals and decisions affecting long-term strategy ... will be difficult.""

""We don't plan shifts in investment on this,"" said the fund manager, who is not authorised to speak to the media, so asked not to be identified.

""If Lee receives a ruling that finalises his detention, of course investor sentiment will be bad on the day, but I don't expect any lasting effect."""
"Financial results of public sector banks for April-June quarter show that they remain fragile. Collectively , they made a loss when their private sector peers turned in profits. This performance was not a one-off. Three years ago, a Reserve Bank of India committee concluded that government as shareholder has suffered negative returns over decades. If this situation prevails in public sector banking, a commercial endeavour, it is because successive governments are able to pass on losses to taxpayers. This cannot continue any longer. NDA has promised to recapitalise its loss making banks and merge some of the weaker ones with sound banks. This is inadequate to deal with a systemic problem where banks flounder once every decade. Recapitalisation, therefore, must be accompanied by deeper banking reforms or else hapless taxpayers will soon be presented with another bailout bill.The primary cause for the current state of affairs is government's majority stake in banks.This forces public sector banks to deal with an additional regulatory layer in the form of the finance ministry . This also leads to attendant problems such as banking heads with too short a tenure, low pay scales and fear of multiple investigators scrutinising commercial decisions in hope of unearthing `corruption'. A commercial enterprise cannot be run this way. Around 17 years ago in an earlier NDA government, finance minister Yashwant Sinha proposed lowering government's stake to 33% which would have removed some constraints public sector bankers work under. This would have provided bankers space to be more nimble and take timely decisions. It is time for current finance minister Arun Jaitley to actualise his predecessor's plan. The government should also allow banks to rework their recruitment practices and pay scales as they need to attract the best talent in the job market."
"Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor traded verbal jabs on Tuesday as the circuslike countdown to their moneyspinning superfight cranked into overdrive on the Las Vegas Strip.Thousands of fans including a sizeable contingent of Irish supporters thronged the heart of the Nevada boxing capital to greet Mayweather and McGregor at their separate formal grand arrival ceremonies. Mayweather, the 40-year-old undefeated former welterweight boxing champion, has been lured out of retirement to face McGregor, a star of mixed martial arts' Ultimate Fighting Championship. The two men meet in a 12-round contest under boxing rules on Saturday that is tipped to become the richest fight in history. The cross-combat collision has appalled boxing purists, with many decrying the event as a farcical publicity stunt more in keeping with the choreographed traditions of WWE wrestling. Mayweather and McGregor who clashed repeatedly during an expletive-laden world press tour to drum up interest for the fight last month, in sist however that they are ready to deliver a battle for the ages. McGregor, a massive underdog in what will be his first professional boxing fight, insisted on Tuesday he was ready to stun the oddsmakers. “This is not even close to my toughest challenge ever. I will crumble him,“ McGregor said. “I have adapted perfectly to boxing, I am very pleased and ready . I'm a special man, I will prove that August 26, this will go one or two rounds, maybe I will bang him out and hurt him. “If he survives, I will decide whether I embarrass or seriously hurt him. I am calm and cool, same as I am in every fight. I am fit, sharp and I am gonna be ruthless in there. I believe he will be unconscious inside one round.“ McGregor and Mayweather passed each other after their separate introductions, with McGregor taunting the American with a shout of “Why didn't you want to face off ?“ -triggering a melee between their two entourages. A relaxed-looking Mayweather meanwhile had earlier encouraged fans to bet on the fight finishing inside 12 rounds.“I talked to you before and said that this fight wouldn't go the distance,“ Mayweather said. “If you're going to bet, bet it won't go (the distance).“"
"For the fans of Paris St. Germain, this summer has been a season in wonderland. First, their club signed the player poised to take over the mantle of the world's best from Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.Neymar Junior didn't exactly come cheap, but buying out his Barcelona contract was a huge statement of intent from a club with serious Champions League ambitions. Now, it appears that PSG are also in pole position to sign the game's most exciting young striker, AS Monaco's Kylian Mbappe. All of 18, Mbappe scored 26 goals in 44 matches last season as Monaco stormed to the title, and reached the last four of the Champions League. PSG, humiliated 6-1 at the Camp Nou in a Champions League round-of-16 tie last March -Neymar was the central figure in Barcelona's comeback from a 4-0 first-leg debacle -clearly feel that he and Neymar, along with a star support cast, could seriously challenge Real Madrid. Real themselves were prepared to break the piggy bank to get Mbappe. After all, they have had a prudent summer, spending slightly less than £43 million, and recouping more than 110m in player sales.With Ronaldo now 32 and Gareth Bale increasingly injury-prone, Mbappe would have doubtless been an exciting addition to a forward line that has no equal in the game today. But PSG have blown that plan out of the water. Real may have been prepared to match the £128m pounds that's apparently been offered to Monaco, but the salary that PSG have proposed, rumoured to be £265,000 a week, is twice what they were prepared to write off at the Santiago Bernabeu. This is where the mathematics of it all becomes increasingly dodgy. PSG's t ra nsfer out l ay for t wo pl ayer s a lone would be in the region of 330m pounds. Add in agents' fees, and the figure nudges closer to 400m. In 2015-16, the last fu l l season for which numbers are available in the public domain, the club's revenue was 389.6m pounds. Manchester United topped the list at 515.3m, while Real had slipped to third on 463.8m.Essentially, PSG have spunked a year's revenue on buying two players. That's without factoring in a huge wage bill, bonuses and the like. The Qatar government, for whom the club has become an even more important symbol given their political isolation in the region, continues to pump in the funds, making a mock ery of UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. Comparisons have been made to Real, and the Galacticos era, when they signed the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo and David Beckham. That is an erroneous correlation. When Real signed Zidane from Juventus in 2001, they paid close to 77m Euros for him. Their revenue that year was 138m Euros, and they also let go a bunch of players that summer. Whether it's Real, Barcelona or United, windows of extravagant spending have always gone handin-hand with players being let go. PSG are trying to get around the FFP rules by taking Mbappe initially on loan, and it would be a travesty if such creative accounting was used to justify moves that have warped an already dysfunctional transfer market. Before PSG, it was Lyon that used to dominate French football, and their club president, Jean-Michel Aulas, spoke recently of how it would help no one to get into a `bicep surge'. What PSG are doing is essentially financial doping, the monetary equivalent of a track athlete, cyclist or swimmer using steroids.The Neymar deal, more than twice as lucrative as the previous record transfer, has set an unhealthy precedent, with buy-out clauses now being raised to ludicrous levels. Real's Marco Asensio, at 21, is another of the game's brightest young talents. When they do get him to sign a new and improved contract, expect a buy-out fee in excess of half a billion Euros. The current one is set at a trifling 350m. Football truly has gone mad."
"For the last two weeks, officials of the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) are out to capture and relocate the tiger that has killed three people in Amaraya and other areas close to the forest. Though the teams comprising more than 60 officials have limited its movement to an area of 12 sq km, the tiger still remains elusive. The officials are monitoring the tiger’s movement and are arranging live baits for it. They said the animal was hiding in thick sugarcane fields and was coming out only in the night in search of prey. “It is like a game of chess. We cannot venture into the fields after sunset due to operational limitations and the tiger begins its movement once we retract,” DFO (social forestry) Adarsh Kumar, who is heading the search operation."
"Former Mumbai stalwart Amol Muzumdar is in the city guiding a bunch of first-class cricketers from New Zealand -Canterbury Cricket Club -as part of a five-day training programme organised by Global Cricket School and Cricket Drome. Muzumdar, who has a staggering 11167 first-class runs, got to work as batting consultant at the Cricket Drome facility on Wednesday .The 42-year-old former Mumbai skipper, who is a consultant with Global Cricket School, said it felt great to be back at the “home of spin“ in India. “Chennai is my second assignment as consultant.Earlier last year, I had worked with a visiting South Africa A side in Mumbai. It feels good to be here. Cricket is a global game and it's wonderful to pass on the knowledge I had gained playing cricket for nearly two decades,“ he told TOI. Former New Zealand batsman Gary Stead is in charge of the 10 players. Some of the exciting talents to watch out for in the group are pacer Henry Shipley and left-arm spinner Jeremy Benton, who represented New Zealand in the U19 World Cup. Muzumdar mentioned his primary agenda is to give assurance to the youngsters that most things that have been said about the `difficult Indian conditions' is a “myth.“ The Indo-NZ coaching duo challenged the young lot with quite a few game scenarios on day one. At the end of it, Muzumdar said their adaptability was “spot on“ from ball one. “They come from proper cricketing background. I was impressed with their adaptability factor which was spot on. One scenario was to put them under scoring pressure and see how they react to it,“ added Muzumdar,."

Notts are wellplaced for an immediate return to the eight-team elite of the county championship as they lead Worcestershire at the top of the second tier by 35 points. “The great thing is that he (Pujara) has already been in the squad this season and he fitted in so well both on and off the field,“ said Moores. “He is a fantastic player, and since he has been away he has had a great time of it in the Test matches for India. “So we are getting a guy who is coming back in form and for the team spirit, `Pudji' coming back in is a huge boost for everybody.“ He shone for Notts earlier in the season, scoring 223 runs in four matches before leaving to play for his country.He will be available for the final four matches of the run-in. Pujara will have the chance to pit his wits in a fascinating duel with fellow Indian Test star and spin maestro Ravichandran Ashwin, who has signed for Worcestershire. Afridi's maiden T20 ton lifts Hampshire: Pakistan's Shahid Afridi blasted 101 in only 43 balls to inspire Hampshire's 101-run victory at Derbyshire in the Twenty20 Blast quarterfinals on Tuesday. All-rounder Afridi hit seven sixes and 10 fours to power Hampshire to 249 for eight, their highest T20 score. The Falcons crumbled to 148 all out with Liam Dawson and Kyle Abbott each taking three wickets.Hampshire promoted Afridi to opener against the county he played for in 2003 and he swept and drove four boundaries from Wayne Madsen's first over before Calvin Dickinson took two fours from Hardus Viljoen."

Photographers Who Find Magic In The Mundane: Sankar Sridhar

“I return to my subjects from time to time so that I don’t miss out on a single facet of their lives”

(Click on any image to read Sridhar’s perceptive anecdotes about its origin)

Six-year-old Changpa Tsering tries to hide the embarrassment that follows a scolding by pretending to untangle the knotty hair of her family’s herd of goats

When it comes to adjectives that describe his art, Sankar Sridhar likes to be associated with the word ‘slow’. For that’s the kind of photographer he is, taking a fortnight or longer getting to know his subjects before he photographs them. He usually clicks people whose lives are far removed from his own because of the unique perspective it provides for his lens.

For a Rabari elder, walking barefoot is more comfortable than wearing shoes. “You feel the earth without shoes and only grit and thorns with them”, he explains.

What usually brings the subject to your attention?

“Books and serendipity during my travels.”

Creased, calloused and flaking, the hands of a Rabari woman reveal the toll that work and weather takes on the life of a nomad.

Describe your experience shooting with the subject

“I like spending as much time as I can with my subjects so that I don’t only capture candid moments but also understand aspects of their lifestyle that need to be documented. I also make it a point to return to them from time to time so that I don’t miss out on a single facet of their lives.”

Changpa children are sometimes left in front of open fires while their mothers go to fetch water. Younger children are kept in the corrals with the goats, where they are warmed by the animals’ body heat.

Which subject has left a lasting impact on you?

“It would have to be pastoral communities like the Changpas, the Rabaris and the Gaddis whom I have observed very closely for weeks on end. They are survivalists who always wear a smile and share a symbiotic relationship with nature. I believe their lives are like a book we should definitely take a leaf out of.”

"Fresh potholes emerging on many roads mean bumpy rides for Bappa and his devotees during Ganesh Chaturthi. While Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has threatened to name the potholes after civic officials if they are not repaired immediately, NMMC has kicked off pothole repairing work. Civic sources said that contractors have been asked to complete pothole filling work before August 25. But residents are not con vinced. Many Ganpati mandal organisers are getting ready for a rough ride as they plan to ferry in the large idols from far-off places. “This year has not been any better considering the road conditions,“ said Parag Rawat, a Koparkhairane resident. “If the roads are not fixed before the festival we will name the potholes after civic engineers and officials,“ said Gajanan Kale, head of city unit of MNS. “Despite rains, we will do our best to finish the work by Thursday night,“ said city engineer Mohan Dagaonkar."
"From a convenient way of looking at posts to being a significant component of advertising budgets the world over -the humble hashtag has come a long way on Twitter. On Wednesday , it turned ten years old. An average of over 125 million hashtags are tweeted each day, according to Twitter. The hashtag was not a feature that Twitter introduced on its own. It was, in fact, users of the microblogging service who figured that the feature could be used in this manner. Tweeting a term with a hash sign before it makes it into a clickable link. One can “tag“ a tweet with a term like #Charlottesville or #IPL. This way not only does the post get categorised in a certain topic, it also becomes searchable. Clicking the tag shows the user all tweets containing the tag. In tech parlance, such public tagging is called “folksonomy .“ On August 23, 2007 social technology professional Chris Messina posted this tweet: “How do you feel about using # (pound) for groups.As in barcamp [msg]?“ Barcamp was the name of a tech nology “unconference“ taking place at the time. According to reports, Twitter co-founder Evan Williams found the hashtag to be too “nerdy“ to become mainstream. The hashtag isn't exclusive to Twitter. In an August 2007 blog post, Messina himself points to the use of the # sign on networks like Jaiku to create “channels“ where a single topic can be followed."

"From page 01 BENGALURU: Infosys Ltd chairman R. Seshasayee may be on his way out even as a chorus calling for the return of co-founder Nandan Nilekani grows louder, five days after chief executive officer Vishal Sikka abruptly resigned and the board blamed former chairman and promoter NR Narayana Murthy for the exit. An Infosys spokesperson would not comment on either Seshasayee or Nilekani. Nilekani did not respond to an email, text message and phone call seeking comment. According to three people directly aware of the latest development, Seshasayee’s future as chairman of Infosys looks precarious and he may step down in the next few weeks, maybe even days. Nilekani, who has had a successful post-Infosys stint as the head of the Unique Identification Authority of India, has previously been reluctant to return to Infosys—Murthy reached out to him after returning as Infosys chairman in 2013 to revive the company’s floundering fortunes—but may not be averse to a temporary non-executive role if it can save the company, a fourth person familiar with the matter said. Mint learns that Nilekani, who was scheduled to travel to the US on a previously planned trip, has deferred his plans because he is very upset at the board’s angry note directed at Murthy and that he has been meeting Murthy every day since. A fifth person said on condition of anonymity that co-chairman Ravi Venkatesan has, over the past few months, sought to convince Nilekani to take over either as chairman or co-chairman. If Seshasayee does resign, then a shake-up of the board is certain, the first three people added. All of them requested anonymity. “There will be sweeping changes on the board,” said one of the three. Mint could not immediately ascertain which board members would quit if Seshasayee resigns, but over the past six months Murthy has called for the resignations of Jeffrey Sean Lehman, who is the head of the nominations and remunerations committee, and Roopa Kudva, who heads the audit committee. Lehman, who has served on the Infosys board for over a decade now, is in any case unlikely to ask for a renewal of his term, which ends in 2018. “Investors’ confidence in the board is at an all-time low, and they want blood,” said Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing-research firm. “Seshasayee is likely to take the fall for the whole Sikka debacle and the rushed acquisition of Panaya. I also expect Roopa Kudva and Jeff Lehman to follow him out.” Mint reported earlier on Wednesday that large institutional investors, proxy advisory firms, brokerages, top executives at the company and some of the company’s 200,000-odd employees have questioned the board on its decision to release a six-page note blaming Murthy for Sikka’s resignation. On Wednesday, some domestic institutional investors and former employees of Infosys called for Nilekani’s return to the company. Since the company released the letter blaming Murthy, he and the other founders have spoken to large institutional investors of Infosys and have gone about garnering support for a potential showdown with the board. Murthy, who was supposed to address investors on Wednesday, postponed the meeting to next week after being taken unwell, according to two more people aware of the developments. “The company does not have any further updates to share at this point of time. In case there are any developments we will inform the media in due course. We will not be making any comments on speculation and rumours,” said the spokeswoman. This is not, however, the first time that Seshasayee has faced pressure to resign. Over the past six months, Murthy himself has called for Seshasayee’s resignation several times for what he has perceived as serious breaches of corporate governance, based primarily on the board’s handling of the Panaya acquisition and its subsequent investigation and its now-infamous decision to pay a ₹17.38-crore severance to former CFO Rajiv Bansal. For his part, Seshasayee himself has conceded that he has come close to resigning from his position as chairman of Infosys over the past 18 months but said that he didn’t think that would have solved the problem."
"From page 01 The government initiated swift administrative action against the top railway bureaucracy after the weekend tragedy. The upheaval is likely to bring major restructuring in the Railway Board after decades. The entire board was sacked in 1980 when Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister. Prime Minister Modi chose Prabhu in November 2014 to head the world’s fourth-largest rail network that has 12,000 passenger trains and 7,000-odd stations, and carries 23 million passengers each day — equivalent of Australia’s population. The government is trying to revamp the transporter but fatal crashes, poor revenue and work sloth have dented the railways’ credibility. “Prabhu was inconsolable and had been contemplating resignation,” a source close to him said. The minister has been under pressure from the opposition Congress after the spate of disasters. He countered through tweets that “in less than three years as minister, I have devoted my blood and sweat for” improving the railways. “Under leadership of PM, tried to overcome decades of neglect through systemic reforms in all areas leading to unprecedented investment and milestones,” he said. More than 650 people have lost their lives in 346 train disasters on Prabhu’s watch. When Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief headed the ministry in 2004 to 2007, the railways recorded 759 deaths from 663 accidents. If his resignation is accepted, he will be the second railway minister to lose his job after fatal train tragedies. Lal Bahadur Shastri resigned in 1956 when 144 passengers were killed in Tamil Nadu. Madhavrao Scindia, Nitish Kumar and Mamata Banerjee offered to resign. But their resignations were rejected."
"From page 01 US President Donald Trump on Tuesday mounted an aggressive defence of his response to a deadly far-right march in Virginia, using a rally speech to condemn “dishonest” media coverage of his widely criticised remarks. Trump faced bipartisan outrage after blaming “many sides” for violence at the rally in Charlottesville, in which one anti-fascist protester was killed. Re-reading his statements that followed the clashes, he railed at reporters at the rally in Phoenix, Arizona, for misrepresenting his remarks — but omitted the equivocation that had sparked the backlash in the first place. Trump dedicated about half an hour of his 78-minute speech to attacking the “sick people” in the news media, before turning his fire on his own side. The speech was cheered raucously by supporters inside the conference centre, though thousands of anti-Trump protesters, who had lined up under a blistering sun in Phoenix hours before Trump’s arrival, later clashed with police outside the venue. Speculation had been building that Trump would use the rally to formally endorse a challenger to Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, a moderate incumbent, in a shot across the bow of sceptical Republicans. He mocked both Flake and fellow Arizona Republican Senator John McCain, implying that McCain had sabotaged Republican healthcare reforms, but elaborately avoided mentioning either by name. Veering off script, Trump shied away from issuing a pardon for Joe Arpaio -- a former sheriff in Arizona who was convicted of wilfully violating a court order to stop targeting Hispanics in immigration roundups. His visit to Arizona aimed to tout the benefits of a border fence with Mexico, turn up the heat on reluctant allies and demonstrate his determination to realise a central campaign pledge. Trump had insisted that Mexico would pay for the wall, estimated to cost about $22 billion. Having failed in that bid, he has turned to equally reticent Republicans in Congress to get US funding. But with his plan running into political quicksand, Trump is trying to generate public pressure on reluctant lawmakers to support him. In Phoenix, Trump told the rally crowd his message for “obstructionist” Democrats was that he was building the wall “if we have to close down our government.” The freewheeling speech left some critics dumbfounded, with former national intelligence director James Clapper questioning Trump’s fitness to lead and his access to the country’s nuclear codes."
"From page 1 LUDHIANA: Struggling to improve its financial condition, the municipal corporation (MC) is now planning to purchase eight new Bolero cars for its officials. According to sources, a proposal to purchase eight new cars at a cost of Rs 64 lakh will be presented before the Finance and Contract Committee (F&CC) on Thursday. Notably, development projects including renovation of multi-level parking, modernisation of slaughter house, among others were hanging fire due to fund crunch. Besides, the civic body has also failed to release pending payments to the contractors. The MC had postponed its F&CC meeting in July as the members of the committee demanded commencement of earlier works which have been passed by the committee. The SAD-BJP leaders had then claimed that the state government should first release the funds for completion of ongoing works which were put on halt after the Congress came into power. An official requesting anonymity said the agenda which was prepared for the last meeting will also be presented before the panel during the meeting on Thursday. Besides, proposals for seven new parking lots, development of parks, road works and installation of tubewells at different areas in city would be presented. Other proposals including setup of smart vending zones near Canal Bridge at BRS Nagar will also be presented before the panel, he said. The meeting will be held at mayor’s camp office."
"From page 3 RAIPUR: BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh’s official body for bovine welfare has a recommended buying cow urine from cattle owners to discourage the people from abandoning their livestock. Visheshar Patel, the chairman of the state’s Gau Sewa Ayog, told Hindustan Times , on Tuesday that the urine can be used for research to develop different products including fertilisers and pesticides. Patel’s comments came days after nearly 200 cows were found dead in three shelters run by a BJP leader, sparking criticism of the Raman Singh government which has made cow protection part of its official agenda. “We have sent this proposal and we believe that cow urine should be purchased by the government at ~10 per litre. If this project starts, the people of the state who are abandoning the cows will keep them home for monetary benefits,” Patel added. “Dus nahi..paanch ya saat rupaye bhi per litre ho jayega to kisan gaayo ko ghar mein rakhenge...raste mein nahi chhodenge (Even if the people get ~5-7, the people will not abandon their cows),” he added. Many people abandon their cows after the animals stop giving milk or turn infirm due to old age, often leading to bovine deaths due to hunger and illness. The cow commission has estimated Chhattisgarh’s cow population to be 92 lakh bovines. It also runs 115 cowsheds in different parts of the state. He said, cow urine will be used to make “pesticide (jaivik keetniyantrak) and fertiliser (jeevamirt khaad)” besides “amritpaani”, which he described as a miracle solution that could revitalise barren land. BJP leaders and other groups affiliated to the party have been making many claims about medicinal and other benefits of cow urine, which experts say are not scientifically proven."

Give ‘imaginative diplomacy’ a chance

G Parthasarathy

DENG Xiao Ping, who survived Maoist repression and became China’s supreme ruler from 1978 to 1997, set the stage for dumping Maoist communist dogma and releasing the creative energy of Chinese entrepreneurship. He rationalised discarding orthodox Communist ideology, proclaiming: “It does not matter if a cat is black or white, as long as it can kill mice.” Deng was the “helmsman” of China’s breath-taking economic growth, which transformed his country into the world’s economic powerhouse, within three decades. Deng urged caution in the conduct of security policies. Shortly after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, Deng advised his countrymen: “Observe calmly, secure our position, cope with affairs calmly, hide our capabilities and bide our time”. Deng had practical reasons for rendering this advice to his countrymen. China was badly mauled during the Ussuri river clashes with the Soviet Union in 1969. Worse still, was the humiliation China suffered following Deng’s visit to Washington in 1978, where he was feted, wined and dined by President Carter and the barons of American business. Shortly thereafter, he proclaimed: “Vietnam is a hooligan. We must teach it a lesson.” It was, however, China which was taught a lesson by Vietnam, when it invaded its neighbour in 1979. Deng faced a similar setback in 1986, when China’s PLA occupied vacated Indian posts in Sumdorong Chu/Wangdung in Arunachal Pradesh. India responded by airlifting forces to the McMahon Line, along the Sino-India border. Deng warned India in 1986 that it would be taught a “lesson” if it did not withdraw its forces, with US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger acting as an intermediary. New Delhi, however, stood firm and a military stalemate followed. External affairs minister ND Tiwari visited Beijing in May 1987 and clarified that India was not interested in escalating tensions, while holding out the possibility of a visit to China by PM Rajiv Gandhi. The visit took place in November 1988, with Deng personally welcoming the “young” Indian PM and setting the stage for seeking a new relationship with India. Chinese troops, however, pulled back fully from Sumdorong Chu only in 1993. China’s misadventure in Sumdorong Chu led to Arunachal Pradesh soon becoming a state of the Indian Union in 1987. Much has changed in the last three decades in China. It is now an economic powerhouse with a GDP five times that of India and defence spending six times that of India. China has impressive defence production facilities and armed forces with huge firepower. But, China’s economic rise has also led to the country discarding Deng’s prescription of “hide our capabilities and bide our time”. China is now flexing its economic and military muscle across Asia, while also using its maritime power across the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean Regions. The use of maritime power has been accompanied by China defining its maritime borders arbitrarily, drawing a “nine dotted line”, to occupy and build military bases on several islands, hundreds of miles from its shores, which are legally claimed by its neighbours. Its maritime boundary claims, many coercively enforced, have included unilaterally defining its maritime boundaries with South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia. Beijing has, however, been circumspect, in not biting off more than it can chew, on in its maritime boundaries with Japan! China has coerced a number of ASEAN countries, compelling them not to join partners like Vietnam and Indonesia, which have demanded that Beijing should adhere to rulings of the UN Arbitration Tribunal on its maritime boundaries. This fear of Chinese power has torn ASEAN solidarity apart, with many ASEAN members refusing to accept any critical references to China in the recent ministerial conference in the Philippines. Not content with establishing its hegemony in Southeast Asia, China has also moved to contain and erode India’s influence in South Asia and the Indian Ocean. The ambivalence of the Trump administration on containing Chinese power and its revocation of the Trans-Pacific (economic) partnership has raised serious doubts about American reliability as an economic and military partner in East and Southeast Asia. China has benefited immensely from this. Pakistan is predictably the primary instrument for China’s policy of “containment” of India. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, stretching from the PoK to the port of Gwadar, has been accompanied by a decision to enhance Pakistan’s maritime power, with a decision to supply eight frigates and eight submarines to Pakistan. Across India’s eastern shores, China has outmanoeuvred the US, Japan and India by strengthening its political and economic influence in the economic and political policies of Aung San Suu Kyi. It is set to build the strategic port of Kyaukpyu in the Bay of Bengal, while shaping its maritime silk road by taking over Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka. Riding on hubris, China, however, gravely miscalculated what the response of India and Bhutan would be to its intrusion in Doklam. By its intrusion in Doklam, Beijing violated written agreements with Bhutan signed in 1988 and 1998, which pledged to “maintain status quo on the boundary as before March 1959”, and “refrain from taking unilateral action, or use of force, to change the status quo on the boundary”. It also violated the December 2012 “common understanding” reached by Special Representatives of India and China, agreeing to maintain the status quo, pending a tripartite agreement on the location of the India-China-Bhutan tri-junction. China has now landed itself in a military and diplomatic quagmire. The Sikkim-Bhutan border is the worst location for China for a confrontation with India. India has huge advantages in terrain, logistics, firepower and numbers in this area. Any military misadventure could destroy the image of invincibility the Chinese have assiduously built, while bullying weaker maritime neighbours. China can possibly undertake intrusions in sections of its borders with India, where it enjoys logistical advantages. India has to be prepared for this. In the meantime, imaginative diplomacy is required to ensure China is given a face-saving way out from its present predicament. A visit by Mr Modi to China for the forthcoming BRICS Summit would largely depend on his reading of Chinese intentions and flexibility. Much will, however, depend on how President Xi Jinping decides to deal with domestic challenges he is likely to face during the forthcoming Communist Party Congress, scheduled for later this year."
"Garba, a dance form which is not just not known for Navratri but a dance form preferred by many for pre and post events. It is all about some garba lovers meeting and you see the graceful swirls and twirls. The city is right now in the same dancing mode. We take a look at some dance classes of the city to check how well garba enthusiasts are twisting on garba tunes. The salsa and Bollywood style garba being in trend, let us see what t h i s Navratri is going t o turn like. Amdavadis gear up for Navratri well in advance.Radhika Marfatia, who started teaching garba from July end,says, “Salsa and Bollywood style garba is in trend on the song which is a remake of Mehendi Te Vavi.Except that, people are crazy about learning the traditional garba like basic Do taali, Teen taali, D a u d h i y u , Popatiyu, Heench, Baroda, Surti and Bombay style garbas. For kids there is garba with props like beda and mandvi.The age group varies from 5-45.The number of home makers has gone up this time and instead of gymming many of them have now joined the garba classes.“ Dharmesh Shah, who has been teaching garba now for 10 years shares, “There are all age groups for garba classes. All of them are crazy about garba. There are lot of nonGujaratis this year who want to learn garba properly and enjoy the nine nights completely. We have been doing western, hip hop, hudo, dandiya, and basic garbas. Batches for slow motion and break dance garba will start from the next month as these forms will be done by some of the garba players and experts.“ Supriya Shah who got inspired by the viral video of salsa garba happening in Surat, too have the dance form along with disco dandiya. He adds, “We have two batches, one which is fun, western style garba with touch of Bollywood and the other batch is all traditional which has basic do taali, 3 taali with 16,18, 32, 64 steps and Kutchi style garba. The garba lessons began with the beginning of this month and we are soon to start with the corporate batches in the next month.“ Ahmedabad is going all gaga about western style garba, there are people like Khushbu Shah who is busy showing only traditional style garba. She believes, “We being the pioneers of this dance form cannot let the authenticity go by doing and adapting the western version of this garba. The students learning garba are really passionate about desi style garba. The `in' thing this year is of course, the partner work where you don't need huge groups but can be done with your partner. Interestingly , there's a health angle to it also.Amdavadis have become health conscious and they join in garba to lose weight, to bring that stamina back of dancing for three hours continuously .“ The fitness side of garba is way too wonderful when there is zumba, dance aerobics and garba on garba tunes. Ruju Desai, the fitness expert who has been giving these workout sessions which starts before one month of Navratri, says, “The normal zumba and dance aerobics turn into garba for a month in all the batches. And these are male and female partners doing it in different batches. This greatly helps in workout.“ Priyanka Brijen shares the belly form of garba which is called belly garba which was practiced by her some four years back and it went viral. She says, “We do belly dance steps with garba, the authentic garba steps with a touch of belly dance moves. And we dance on only garba songs, as this is practiced by girls and women, it looks very graceful while dancing on the ground. The women dancing on it enjoy as it is something they love and is bit different than others.“"
"GAUTAM SARKAR Bhagalpur, Aug. 23: Bibi Ladli's husband was all set to pronounce "" talaq, talaq, talaq "" in a police station yesterday when a cop came rushing in and said the instant divorce had been outlawed by the Supreme Court. The divorce was called off and Ladli, a resident of Bihar's Bhagalpur, was taken back by her husband Mohammad Imran. Imran, 26, a jewellery maker, had driven Ladli, 22, out of their home after she delivered twin girls in a hospital on May 9. "" Since she gave birth to the two daughters through a Caesarean section, Imran's family thinks the chances of her bearing another child are bleak. Because of family pressure, Imran decided to leave his wife,"" said Shabana Daud, a local social activist who said she had been mediating between the families for a while. Shabana said she took Ladli to Imran's house in Bhagalpur's Kavirpur on Monday along with Ladli's parents and some policemen. Ladli, whose father is a tailor, had earlier told the police that her in- laws used to torture her. "" Imran's family members, who had earlier snatched the two newborns from Ladli, assaulted her and her mother in front of us and the police,"" Shabana said. "" We decided that it was better they separated and that we would go to the police station for the talaq and later start legal proceedings against Imran and his family. Since we wanted to file a case against Imran and his family for torturing Ladli, the police station was deemed the ideal place for the talaq ,"" Shabana added. Imran, she said, was to utter talaq thrice in the presence of witnesses at 8.30am on Tuesday at Madhusudhanpur police station. "" Her husband and his relatives arrived at the police station around 12.30pm. Around 1pm, when Imran was finally ready, a policeman rushed in shouting that the proceedings must be stopped,"" Shabana said. The policeman, who had been watching the news on TV at the quarters beside the police station, warned Imran of legal consequences if he went ahead with the instant triple talaq . "" Imran and his family decided not to go ahead with the divorce,"" Shabana said. "" Imran also promised to take Ladli back. We happily went to Imran's house with Ladli. Ladli was weeping with joy after being reunited with her daughters."" Ladli was so overcome with emotion that she could barely speak. "" The Supreme Court's judgment was indeed a judgement from Allah. I am indebted to the court for saving my family,"" she said. The prospect of legal action also seemed to have changed Imran's attitude. "" I was on the wrong path but the court's verdict stopped me from committing a sin. I will try to keep my wife happy with me,"" he said. Asked about possible legal action against Imran for domestic violence, Shabana said since the matter had been settled amicably, it would not be pursued. "" All is well now and the girl was last night sent to her parents for 15 days with her daughters as she has not yet fully recovered from the surgery,"" Shabana said. "" Imran will go there to take her back after 15 days in front of people from the society,"" she added.

National Conference president Farooq Abdullah on Wednesday reiterated that all state political parties should get united for protection of Article 35-A, cautioning that it would be “devastating” for the state if the constitutional provision is scrapped.



“The scrapping of Article 35A will lead to a storm which will create devastation with each passing day,” he said, addressing party workers from Kulgam, Beerwah and Dooru at his residence here.

“The time demands that people of J&K along with the mainstream parties should set aside their differences and get united to defend Article 35-A,” Farooq said in a statement.



The removal of the Article would pave way for outsiders and non-state subjects to apply for jobs, buy land and participate in elections in J&K, he said.



“That will lead to loss of our identity and our special status,” he warned.

Farooq said Article 35-A was more advantageous to people of Ladakh and Jammu than Kashmiris.



Meanwhile, a team of civil society members comprising advocate GN Shaheen, a senior member of Kashmir High Court Bar Association (KHBA), Awami National Conference president Muzaffar Shah and Jagmohan Singh Raina, president Kashmir Sikh Coordination Committee called on Farooq at his Gupkar residence and sought his help in building a broader political consensus on protection of Article 35-A, a NC spokesman said in a statement.



“During the course of discussions, Abdullah assured full support and offered to work for a united fight for protection of the Article to the members who are part of the coordination committee ‘We the People’ constituted for protection of Article 35-A,” he said.



“He (Farooq) told the civil society members that protecting the Article has become an issue of identity for the people of Jammu and Kashmir as granting property rights to non-state subject would change the demography in the state and new law would be used to covert majority into minority,” the spokesman said.



He told the delegation the scrapping of the Article 35-A is a threat to the religious and cultural identities of all the three distinct regions of the state.



Confirming about the meeting to KNS, GN Shaheen said the meeting was very “cordial and rather a big success.”



“We made it a point that united fight against attempts to scrap Article 35A will be above the lines of religion and region and people of all the three regions of the state would come together to continue struggle for protection of Article 35A till the final resolution of Kashmir issue,” he said.

Senior National Conference leader and Member Legislative Assembly Mendhar, Javed A Rana, today asked government to handle the issue of articles 370, 35A carefully.



He was addressing a workers meet of party in Mendhar office.

Addressing the gathering, Rana said that Jammu and Kashmir state is having special status in country and the whole system of this special status is not new.



""Government should understand that Article 370 and 35A are sensitive issue and is not confined to any religion or region,"" Rana said asking both state and central government to handle the issue carefully keeping in view its sensitivity, a statement here said.



He said that some forces in country are “trying to make it a regional issue but we all need to give befitting reply to these anti-social forces so that such a sensitive issue cannot be given such colour which is against social values.”

On Triple Talaq issue, he said that central government is trying to “interfere in the religious matters which is not a good sign.”

The residents of Shampora near Gunj Baksh Park at Nowhatta in Downtown here have expressed strong resentment over failure of authorities to macadamise dilapidated roads there.



A delegation from the area said authorities several years ago laid dewatering pipes in the lanes. “In absence of repairs, the pipe is exposed which has left the lane road uneven making it difficult for people to walk. The pipe and dilapidated road poses risk of accidents,” the delegation said.

The inhabitants appealed to the local MLA to look into the matter and direct the authorities concerned to macadamise the lane at the earliest.

"Gold bars are seen at the Kazakhstan's National Bank vault in Almaty, Kazakhstan, September 30, 2016.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Gold nudged lower on Thursday, giving up some of its gains made after U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of a government shutdown, with investors remaining focused on a major central bankers conference in Jackson Hole.

Spot gold was down 0.1 percent at $1,287.87 an ounce, as of 0410 GMT, after gaining 0.4 percent in the previous session.

U.S. gold futures for December delivery slipped 0.1 percent to $1,293.30 per ounce.

""It's a bit lower with lack of catalysts and people trading sideways. It's going to be trading in a very tight range,"" said Richard Xu, a fund manager at China's biggest gold exchange-traded fund, HuaAn Gold.

""The market is pricing in the Federal Reserve's actions at the Jackson Hole meeting and people are expecting some kind of tightening going on in that space. So that's why gold is going to be under some kind of pressure.""

Markets were focused on an annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming starting Thursday, where Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi are set to deliver speeches on Friday, on the outlook for monetary policy and interest rates.

ECB's Draghi on Wednesday warned against hasty policy responses and said gaps in understanding the workings of new policies remain.

Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, as these increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.

The dollar inched higher on Thursday, paring some of the losses it suffered after U.S. President Donald Trump suggested a shutdown of the government was possible and threatened to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement.

""Gold has already traded higher compared to a month ago so it's already priced in some of the uncertainty with regards to geopolitical concerns and even U.S. fiscal policy, so we think there's not much upside unless something unexpected happens,"" Xu said.

Spot gold may test a resistance at $1,294 per ounce, a break above which could lead to a gain to the next resistance at $1,297, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said.

Among other precious metals, silver was nearly unchanged at $17.02 an ounce, while platinum edged 0.3 percent lower to $973.00 an ounce.

Palladium remained unchanged at $932.90."
"Great skin is not only the result of using a cleanser, sunscreen or moisturiser religiously. Aside from genetics, your skin may be affected by various other aspects of your daily regimen. Your lifestyle choices and how you go about your day may dry out your skin or cause acne breakouts -in short, undo all the effort you put into your skin care routine. A number of habits may be keeping you from achieving your goal of having glowing, flawless skin, but the good news is these are easy to get past. Experts tell you how and list a few surprising things that may be harming your skin. Spending long hours in an air-conditioned room It's hard to imagine a long car ride or even being at the office, or getting a good night's sleep without the airconditioner on full blast.Without properly ventilated apartments, breathing articificially cooled air is now part and parcel of Mumbai life. Cosmetic physician Dr Manjiri Puranik, founder of Instasculpt, explains how damaging this can be to the skin.Not only does it lead to dryness, poorly maintained AC systems, she says, can be detrimental to your overall health too as it causes bacteria to blow all around. “If you already have skin conditions like eczema, rosacea or psoriasis, air-conditioning can make these worse, by disturbing the skin's natural moisture balance,“ she says.Even if you don't suffer from any of these conditions, air-conditioning can make your skin itchy and flaky.Dr Puranik thus recommends having a moisturiser at hand, and applying it at least thrice a day.“This will counteract the drying effect. Also make sure you're drinking at least eight glasses of water daily to stay hydrated.“ Long, hot showers Cranking up the water temperature for a super-hot shower may seem like a good idea, and may even feel soothing, particularly on a rainy day but it is the last thing your skin needs. “A lukewarm water bath is ideal as far as the skin is concerned,“ says Dr Bharti Patel, Founder, Yashi Skin and Hair Clinic. “It helps clean the skin without robbing it of moisture. Hot water, on the other hand, strips the epidermis of oils, leading to dry, itchy skin. It also removes the protective oils and lipids from your skin, damaging the skin's protective barrier. This further increases transepidermal water loss. If you must bathe with hot water, make it a point to apply a good moisturiser or oil first; also, use a gentle soap or body wash.And, keep the duration of the bath short,“ she says. Exfoliating or waxing frequently Dr Nina Madnani, a dermatologist associated with the P D Hinduja Hospital says that people often develop rough, irritated skin by exfoliating more often than necessary. “It's fine to exfoliate your skin once in few weeks using a gentle scrub. But doing this too often may damage the natural skin barrier of the skin, and lead to redness, irritation, sun sensitivity, eczema or pigmentation,“ Madnani explains.She points out that the skin is naturally exfoliated every day, just by water, wind, bathing, wiping, shaving etc., so exfoliation is really not required. But if you still feel like using a grainy substance to achieve a deep cleanse, she recommends ensuring that the cream you use is not too harsh and to limit usage to once a week. Waxing, an effective hair removal method also has its downside. “Done frequently, this may cause itching, pus filled lesions, pigmentation or skin burns,“ says Dr Kiran V Godse, Consultant Dermatologist, Apollo Hospital. Most people who undergo waxing develop some skin redness and irritation; others may develop reddish bumps, rashes and minor subcutaneous bleeding as well. “This can be avoided by using calamine lotion after waxing and not covering the waxed area,“ Dr Godse says, adding that keeping a gap of at least three weeks between two waxing sessions is advisable.Talking on the cellphone Spending too much time on mobile phone gives rise to a condition called mobile phone dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis. The most common allergen to blame here is nickel, but electromagnetic radiations can also trigger allergic reactions. “Besides, holding a mobile phone close to the skin can cause swelling, redness, itching or blistering near the cheekbones, ears, jaw or hands due to germs on the screen,“ explains Dr Puranik. In addition, looking at the screen constantly also leads to crow's feet around the eyes and wrinkles around the tech-neck area, i.e. the area underneath the chin and around the neck. To avoid the premature wrinkles this may cause, hold your phone at eye level and increase the font-size. Dr Puranik also recommends using hands-free devices like headsets or putting your phone on speaker mode whenever you can, to avoid direct contact with the skin. Also, wipe the screen with anti-bacterial wipes at least once a day.Skipping meals Sometimes even a lunch break looks difficult on a busy work day but missing a meal is not only bad for your tummy, it brings its fair share of troubles for the skin too. “Skipping meals depletes the body of nutrients, leading to dull skin. It can also make your skin lose its elasticity, expediting the appearance of wrinkles“ says Dr Godse. “So make sure you take your meals on time and balance your meals with green leafy vegetables and fruits. Also, drink plenty of water, as this helps the skin glow.“ Your bra straps Dr Godse explains that clothing dermatitis can be caused by wearing clothing -fabrics that come into contact with the skin.He points out that this is mainly the case with synthetic materials.“The source of the skin problem may be the fabric itself or more commonly a contact allergy to the chemical additives used in processing the fabric.“ The allergic skin reactions, he says, are most often a result of resins, dyes, glues, chemical additives and tanning agents. To avoid it, one should wear breathable fabrics -particularly for undergarments. “Creams and ointments may be used to help control itching, swelling, and redness, and in severe cases, oral antibiotics may be prescribed,“ says Dr Godse. Wearing artificial jewellery Dr Bharti Patel points out that artificial jewellery contains nickel, a common allergen that causes dermatitis or eczema. Dr Puranik adds that jewellery may also be designed with hollow portions, areas where dirt and moisture build up, and these may irritate the skin too. “Rings and stud-style earrings are the worst offenders.Besides, often, silver jewellery has no plating on it at all, and this can trigger allergic symptoms and irritate skin.“ Dr Puranik stresses that if you cannot do without wearing costume jewellery, apply a skin protecting cream first -this would form a protective layer on the skin and keep it from being affected by the metal. “Also, limit how long you wear this for.“"

"GURGAON: A team from health department i n Gurgaon has unraveled an alleged sex determination racket that was spread from Haryana to Uttarakhand. A case has been registered under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) act against five persons who allegedly took pregnant women from Haryana to Uttarakhand for conducting sex determination tests. The accused have been identified as Dr Vikas Tomar, Abdul Salar, and Sanjay, Dr Beaula wife of AK Singh of Ms Chouhan hospital, Pataudi. As per the health department, a decoy customer was sent to a hospital after CMO, Rohtak, got information regarding sex determination tests. A pregnant woman approached the Chouhan hospital in Pataudi, and she asked for sex determination to be conducted and a deal was struck for ₹30,000. As the matter pertained to Gurgaon, the Rohtak CMO contacted the health department which formed a team comprising Dr Saryu Sharma, and drug control officer Amandeep Chauhan. As per the plan, the pregnant woman along with her husband reached Pataudi where she met with one Abdul Salar, who is a conduit. Salar took the duo to Roorkee and stopped the vehicle at BSM Chowk where a man on a bike took the woman to Panjam Ultrasound centre. A sex determination test was allegedly conducted there by Dr Vikas Tomar. At the time when the test was being conducted the health department team conducted the raid and recovered ₹4,000 through marked notes. The accused told us that money was exchanged among Sanjay, Abdul Salar and Dr Beuala of Chouhan hospital Pataudi for carrying out the test. Dr Saryu Sharma, who was member of the team, said the accused were trying to evade the law by conducting tests outside the state."
"GURGAON: The Millennium City Expressway Limited (MCEPL) on Wednesday removed construction materials from a road being laid allegedly by a BJP MP near Kherki Daula toll. The toll authorities served a notice to the MP to remove the materials by Wednesday, failing which the concessionaire will remove it. The toll authorities had accused Sukhbir Singh Jaunapuria, BJP MP from Tonk-Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan, of constructing a road adjacent to the national highway and near the toll. The MCEPL is the concessionaire of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and is managed by a consortium of five banks. The lane or land in question where the MP’s men dumped road construction material belonged to the expressway and, thus, the MCEPL is its custodian. The MCEPL officials said that an earthmover was hired and labourers were deployed on site as well to have the construction materials removed. Following a complaint on Sunday, the Kherki toll officials arrived at the spot and stopped the road construction work. “Till Wednesday morning, the MP showed no urgency to remove the construction materials from the spot. Hence, the MCEPL decided to take care of it at its own cost. A bill for the expenses incurred will be sent to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for recovery from the MP. He tried building a link road between his land and the expressway for his personal benefit,” said the MCEPL executive supervising the removal work."
"GURUGRAM: A woman delivered a baby today inside a cab while going to the Civil hospital in the city.

Her husband Ramesh Yadav claimed that when they reached the hospital, they could not get admission for at least an hour, a span which was critical as the woman and the baby were running the risk of getting infection.

However, the hospital authorities denied that there was any delay on their part.

The incident took place this morning.

""I hired a cab to take my wife to the hospital but about two kms from it she delivered the baby inside the car,"" Yadav said.

""On reaching the hospital, I informed the ground staff about the delivery and asked them to admit my wife and the baby,"" he said, adding that he was asked to take them to the gynaecology ward.

At the ward, the staff asked them to wait and even after an hour they were not admitted, Yadav claimed.

The mother-child duo was finally admitted after Yadav approached Principal Medical Officer of the hospital Dr Kanta Goyal.

However, Dr Goyal later said there were no lapses on the part of the hospital.

""The pregnant woman should have been admitted immediately after her labour pain started which was not the case,"" Dr Goyal said.

The mother and the infant are both stable now, the PMO said."
"HC compares short-lifting to illegal mining and upholds imposition of fine, punishment



Fine and punishment for short-lifting (not selling the minimum quantity of hard liquor per month) on liquor vendors is valid, the High Court has held.



The court based its decision on a recent judgement of the Supreme Court in which it was held that the state should be compensated even when mining is done illegally on land that has not been approved for mining. The High Court said that the two issues are similar and the same logic applies.



Fine (`100 per bulk litre) and punishment (cancellation of licence) for short-lifting existed between 2004 and 2014.



In 2014 the rule was removed, but the excise department continued to prosecute liquor vendors for short-lifting in the years the rule existed.



Justice Vineet Kothari recently disposed a batch of petitions filed by bar and restaurant licence holders. The SC judgement earlier in August in an illegal mining case came in handy.





The HC cited that similar contentions about the rules in mines and mineral development regulations was decided in the Karnataka Rare Earth Case and the Common Cause Vs Govt of India and others case, in which the SC “held that such compensation to the state should be fully recovered even if illegal mining of ore was done on any land, even if not covered by mining lease or mining plan.



“This judgement is on all fours to the present case.”



The issue of short-lifting and the challenge to it by bar and restaurants seemed to have reached a finality in June this year when the HC had disposed petitions by several of them ruling in favour of the authorities. But many licence holders approached the HC again claiming that they had additional grounds in the matter and should be heard.



An 1899 law also gave legal sanctity to the rule that existed between 2004 and 2014. The liquor vendors had argued that the 'rule' lacked legislative sanction.



The HC, in its judgement, said that the rule was saved by the General Clauses Act, 1897 “enacted much prior to independence of India even though the word ‘rule’ is not separately mentioned in Section 6 of the Act. The Mysore General Clauses Act 1899 includes ‘rules’ within the definition of ‘enactment’. Therefore, despite some legislative gap for applying a saving clause to a charging provision, it cannot be allowed to fail, more so when the liability to pay pertains to a period when the said charging provision was very much on the statue book.”

"HC upholds relief to Pinarayi in Lavalin case  DH News Service, THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, Aug 24 2017, 1:25  IST     Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan   In a major relief to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, the Kerala High Court on Wednesday upheld a CBI special court judgement which discharged him from the SNC-Lavalin corruption case. The court also upheld the discharge of two former government officials. It, however, set aside the discharge of three former Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) officials, leaving them to face trial. Justice P Ubaid delivered a 102-page judgement on the CBI’s revision petition against the Thiruvananthapuram CBI special court’s November, 2013 judgement, which discharged Vijayan and six others from the case. Vijayan was arraigned as seventh accused. According to the CBI charge sheet, the state suffered a loss of Rs 86.25 crore in awarding a Rs 374.5-crore supply contract to the Canadian firm SNC-Lavalin, to revive three hydro-electricity projects — in Senkulam, Panniyar and Pallivasal. The contract was awarded in 1997, allegedly after procedural violations, when Vijayan was state minister for power. According to the contract, SNC-Lavalin was to provide a grant of Rs 98.3 crore to the Malabar Cancer Centre (MCC) in Thalassery, Kannur. The centre, however, received only about Rs 12 crore and the company backed out of the non-binding agreement. The major charge against Vijayan was that he failed to obtain an enforceable contract from SNC-Lavalin regarding the grant and showed undue haste in executing the contract when the grant was offered.   var vtn_publisher_id=""1076"";                      var vtn_width=""405"";                      var vtn_height=""325"";                      var vtn_title_flag=1;           Email this page     Print this page        (function(d){                     var js, id = 'facebook-jssdk'; if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;}                     js = d.createElement('script'); js.id = id; js.async = true;                     js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1"";                     d.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(js);                   }(document));   Tweet     (function() {                   var po = document.createElement('script'); po.type = 'text/javascript'; po.async = true;                   po.src = 'https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js';                   var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s);                     })();  Go to Top"

"Highlights The girl was tortured, forced to have salt rubbed in her wounds The daughter had been adopted and raised nearly all her life The mother attempted to destroy evidence and her remains by burning it In an affidavit that reads like gothic fiction, investigators describe how a teen reunited with her birth mother last year on an isolated farm in Missouri - only to be tortured there, forced to crawl through hog pens and have salt rubbed in her wounds, and then finally murdered last month and burned in a fire pit. Rebecca Ruud, 39, was arrested Monday by Ozark County sheriff's deputies and charged, among other crimes, with the first-degree murder of Savannah Leckie, whom she had given up for adoption at birth, 16 years before. The baby had been taken in by a husband and wife in Minnesota, according to sheriff's documents, and raised there nearly all her life. But Savannah's adoptive parents eventually divorced, and by late 2016 the teen was having trouble getting along with her adoptive mother's new boyfriend. In November 2016, Ruud, who had been in casual contact with Leckie for years, ""agreed to take Savannah back and she was delivered to Ruud in Ozark County,"" wrote a sheriff's deputy, as he recounted all the things the girl would subsequently endure. A truck driver and volunteer firefighter, Ruud lived on an 81-acre farm near Theodosia - close to the Arkansas border, miles from the nearest paved road. In photos on Ruud's Facebook feed, life after reuniting with her daughter appeared idyllic: all baby goats and pretty dresses. ""She looks just like you,"" a friend wrote beneath a photo of mother and daughter last December. In June, Ruud announced that the pair had even started a family business, making soap, according to the Ozark County Times. ""She wanted this so badly,"" she wrote on Facebook of her daughter. ""To combine two landmark events, her Sweet 16, and the official opening of Our Hidden Holler Farm soap business."" But offline, a sheriff's investigator wrote, the girl's new life was bleak. ""Savannah has been home-schooled and has almost no social contact,"" he wrote. She lived, slept and studied on a property with a generator providing the only electricity,and a well pump for water. Ruud and her boyfriend slept in a converted metal building, like a barn, the deputy wrote in the affidavit. Savannah slept beside them in a camper with a broken air conditioner. ""Savannah's inability to adapt to life on the farm"" became a growing irritant to Ruud, according to the affidavit. Eventually, she worried that the cost of caring for the girl would cost her the farm. ""It's to the point that I either need more help to care for her, or I can do nothing with her,"" Ruud allegedly wrote to Savannah's adoptive mother in late June, a few weeks before the girl disappeared. On July 18, Ruud reported a fire burning at the top of a hill on her property. Less than an acre of brush had burned, and firefighters put it out. But when they returned to the family's makeshift living quarters and asked for water, Ruud refused, according to the affidavit. She said Savannah got a small burn in the fire, and was laying down and couldn't be disturbed. Ruud wouldn't let anyone close to the girl's camper, the firefighters reported. Two days later, Ruud called the sheriff's office. Her daughter had disappeared overnight, she reported. Her favorite pillow, blanket and coloring kit were missing. ""I think she's a runaway,"" Ruud said, according to the affidavit. ""Savannah is blaming herself for the fire."" Rescuers fanned out across the woods and fields. A helicopter and plane searched from above, and missing posters went out as day passed with no sign. Investigators began to get suspicious. Ruud brought Savannah's computer to the local fire department on July 24, according to the affidavit, and asked a technician there to examine it. ""I considered this to be unusual considering law enforcement were actively searching for information leading to Savannah's disappearance,"" a sheriff's deputy wrote. The same day, an ex-boyfriend of Ruud's told investigators he'd seen the girl crawling through hog pens and bathing in ponds before she went missing. The man said Savannah had once cut her arm, an investigator wrote, and ""Ruud scrubbed the affected area with alcohol and salt on a daily basis as a form of discipline."" Ruud and her current boyfriend, Robert Peat Jr., were interviewed at the sheriff's office, according to the affidavit, where the mother allegedly admitted to rubbing salt in Savannah's cut, wrestling the girl in the mud of a pig pen, and other severe forms of discipline. But the couple were becoming less and less cooperative as the search went on, an investigator wrote. Deputies returned to the farm on Aug. 4 - with dogs, state police and a search warrant. They now suspected that Savannah had never left the property. The farm looked different that morning, an investigator wrote. Gates and doors that had been open on previous visits were now chained and locked. Some time after investigators arrived, an affidavit states, Ruud and Peat abruptly left their home. They drove for nearly 100 miles, to Summersville, Missouri, and married each other there, on the same day police combed the farm. Investigators searched carefully - around the barn and the camper where Savannah had lived, and the vacant buildings and derelict vehicles that surrounded it. A few hundred yards from the residences, they found a pile of fresh leaves and branches. The brush pile was speckled with cigarette butts and surrounded by what a deputy described in the affidavit as ""charred earth."" The searchers lifted the brush. A deposit of light ash lay beneath it. In the ash, they sifted out a button, imprinted with little ducks, and finger bones and vertebrae and teeth. The bones were human, a forensic investigator in Springfield, Missouri, told the Ozark County sheriff. They'd been burned at a very high temperature, and had deteriorated so badly that she suspected some chemical was used. The sheriff mentioned the Hidden Holler Farm soap-making enterprise, according to an affidavit, and that his deputies had seen drums of chemicals on the property. He mentioned that soap was made with caustic lye. ""That would do it,"" the forensic investigator said. So the sheriff got a second search warrant. Deputies returned to the farm on Aug. 9. The goats and the couple's guns had disappeared, they noted. They went back over the property, and the ash pile they'd searched before. According to documents published by the Ozark County Times, investigators left with a box of girl's clothing; hair; a knife; a meat grinder; and more than two dozen bottles of lye. ""We're dealing with someone who's tried to dispose of evidence,"" Ozark County Sheriff Darrin Reed told OzarksFirst.com. Reed didn't immediately return a message about the case. Ruud could not be reached, and it's unclear if she has a lawyer. But as investigators studied evidence seized from the farm and continued to investigate this month, they learned that Ruud and her new husband had purchased bus tickets to leave the state. So they asked for an arrest warrant this week. ""I believe Ms. Ruud deliberately and methodically caused the death of Savannah Leckie and then attempted to conceal it by destroying evidence and her remains by fire,"" a sheriff's deputy wrote to a judge, who signed the request and issued the warrant. Two Greyhound busses were to leave Springfield on Monday, according to the affidavit - taking Ruud to Kansas and Peat to Tennessee. The sheriff, Reed, and two deputies drove to the station, arrested Ruud and returned her to the Ozark County jail. She was charged Tuesday with first-degree and second-degree murder, fatal abuse of a child, tampering with evidence and abandoning a corpse - and ""more charges are forthcoming on any individual that was involved in aiding or tampering in this investigation,"" Reed wrote in a news release.

There were reports of 34 people injured in Hong Kong while in the city of Macau, across the Pearl river estuary, three persons were killed, authorities there said. In Hong Kong, more than 450 flights were cancelled, financial markets suspended and schools closed as Hato bore down, the first category 10 storm to hit the city since 2012. "" I've never seen one like this,"" Garrett Quigley, a longtime resident of Lantau island to the west of the city, said of the storm. Many skyscrapers in the usually teeming streets of Hong Kong were empty and dark as office workers stayed at home. Hato, that means "" sky pigeon"" in Japanese, churned up Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour and triggered large swells and big waves on some of the city's most popular beaches, with serious flooding in low- lying areas. In residential districts such as Heng Fa Chuen on densely populated Hong Kong island, waves smashed against the sides of oceanfront buildings and surged over a promenade."
"HOSTS MAY BRING CHANDIMAL BACK IN THE XI Our BUREAU & AGENCIES Calcutta/ Pallekele: At their ruthless best now, India lynching Sri Lanka on yet another occasion would obviously be the most expected thing when both teams clash in the second ODI in Pallekele on Thursday. Right from the start of the tour, India have dominated Sri Lanka and their dominance has been extended in the one- day series as well, as the hosts were handed a nine- wicket thrashing with more than 20 overs to spare. For sure, India are playing good cricket at the moment, making the best use of their talent and skills. At least basics wise, there cannot be any complaint regarding how Virat Kohli and his men are going about. But what's aiding India further is Sri Lanka's inability to put forward any kind of resistance. Even when situations looked to be in their favour, the hosts either came up with atrocious batting or were extremely mediocre in the field that helped India regain momentum quite easily. They certainly had a chance in the first ODI when they were 130- odd for one and scoring at a healthy rate. Then all of a sudden they lost nine wickets for 70- odd. There's absolutely for such a collapse on a flat wicket and that too, against India's second- string bowling attack. In other words, the script continues to be the same ever since the very first day of the first Test. Such has been Sri Lanka's performance that supporters stopped the team bus after the first ODI, demanding answers for a shoddy show. So, is there going to be a reversal of fortunes on Thursday, or will India continue pummelling the hosts? No wonder majority would be expecting another smooth sailing for the Indians. With Shikhar Dhawan continuing to plunder runs and the likes of Akshar Patel and Yuzvendra Chahal taking wickets along with keeping things tight, India are likely to go in with the same XI that won by nine wickets in Dambulla. Besides, the wickets for ODIs in Sri Lanka do not afford the luxury of playing three spinners. Thus, unless the Pallekele wicket is exceptionally dry, Kuldeep Yadav could be left out once again, along with Manish Pandey, Ajinkya Rahane and Shardul Thakur. It will be interesting if Kohli shuffles his batting order a bit to give Lokesh Rahul and Kedar Jadhav some batting time, considering the inept Sri Lankan bowling which has seemed clueless so far. On the other hand, there have been questions raised about Sri Lanka's team selection policies too. Test captain and one of Sri Lanka's most attacking batsmen, Dinesh Chandimal, was left out of the playing XI as ODI skipper Upul Tharanga — generally an opener — came out to bat at No. 4, where Chandimal bats. This has set tongues wagging that all is not well in the Sri Lankan dressing room, with coach and captain being over- ridden by others. Sri Lanka need to win two ODIs in this series to make sure that West Indies do not overhaul them in the ODI rankings and gain automatic qualification for the 2019 ODI World Cup before the September 30 deadline. The hosts need more responsibility and stability in their batting ranks, and could look to bring back Chandimal. It is tough to see who they will leave out, though, as the top order did well enough to put the Indian attack under pressure, until at least the 28th over when Lanka were placed at 150/ 3, thanks to the exploits of Danushka Gunathilaka, Niroshan Dickwella and Kusal Mendis.  Match starts: 2.30pm."
"Hrithik Roshan’s Kaabil released in January. Shah Rukh Khan whose Raees released on the same day has had another release  Jab Harry Met Sejal  while Hrithik is yet to confirm his next project. The actor, who was at a Rado event to introduce the new range of watches, spoke to us about the film that is likely to be his next release  Super 30, a biopic on mathematician Anand Kumar. Here the actor talks about his next project for the first time...Meeting Anand Hrithik met Anand recently at his house. Talking about the meeting, Hrithik says, “I had a very nice meeting with him. He’s a fantastic person. Apart from the movie, I have engaged in a lot of other conversations with him about his life. It’s an extremely inspirational journey.” ‘You need not be identical’  One of the major highlights of any biopic is the way an actor moulds and adapts himself while playing a real person on screen. Picking up nuances like walking and talking like the subject. However, Hrithik has a different approach. He says, “That is a very individualistic approach. You don’t have to mimic or mirror someone to play them in a film. You need not be identical, so why even try doing that? That’s one way to do it, maybe. But the other way is to narrate a story and to project the emotions in the best way that suits the actor. It depends on how you want to play it. For me, it’s not important to be exactly like the person who I’m playing. I didn’t even do it for Akbar. It’s purely the emotional journey that needs to be communicated.”The waiting gameIn the last seven months, there have been some projects with Hrithik’s name attached to them, but none have been made official. Prod him further about Super 30 and he says, “It’s too early to get into such details. I am also looking at many other scripts. Nothing is official right now. But yes, this seems like a very, very good journey for me to collaborate on. We have to wait for the official announcement.”Maths  not a problem!Mathematics spells horror for most people, but Hrithik seems perfect to play the part as he tells me, “I was pretty good at Mathematics as a kid. Unlike others, I used to love solving Maths problems.” And his sons seem to have inherited that from him, “I don’t need to sit and teach Maths to my kids (Hrehaan and Hridhaan) because they are also very good at it.”"
"Huma Qureshi, who made her international debut with Gurinder Chadha's 'Partition: 1947', is being lauded for her performance in the period drama. While many are calling it her career's finest performance so far, one cannot miss the fact that it comes close on the heels of Jolly LLB 2, which saw her make a smooth transition from a critically acclaimed actress to a successful commercial star. Huma has also added another feather to her cap — she has been roped in as the lead actress opposite Rajinikanth in the upcoming Tamil film, 'Kaala Karikaalan'.The actress, who made an unconventional debut with 'Gangs of Wasseypur', has delivered several noteworthy performances. Having collaborated with actors belonging to various genres — Rajinikanth, Akshay Kumar, Varun Dhawan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Om Puri, to name a few — she has explored different kinds of cinema, be it in India or the West. With her acting prowess and commercial viability, she is enjoying the best of both worlds."
"Humans have been developing artificial intelligence to make their lives simpler. Robots have been created worldwide to make jobs quicker and effectively. While robots are mostly seen in factories to make manufacturing and other tedious jobs simpler it is the first time a robot did a journalist’s job. Scientists have already predicted that artificial intelligence will replace human workers in the near future and to prove the point a robot covered a football match. Korean News Agency Yonhap has introduced an automated reporting system to cover the English Premier League (EPL). Expanding technology-based journalism, the South Korean news agency revealed that they have started using a computer to write match reports.

Yonhap said that they tested the software during the 2016-2017 season. The Sccoerbot program has been created to copy the writing style of human sports reporters. And journalists if you are listening, Soccerbot wrote 380 articles and filed it between one and two seconds of the final whistle. Yonhap also revealed that they will develop a software to write reports during the 2018 Winter Olympics that will be held in Pyeongchang in the north of South Korea. The robot also reported on the clash between Leicester City and Arsenal during the Premier League’s 2017-2018 season on Friday. Now, you can custom design robots within minutes

Soccerbot writes in Korean on a database of phrases used by Yonhap’s writers in the past. The software then edits its own copy by running a spell and grammar check and also rectifies factual errors. However, it is unsure if Soccerbot’s copy is edited by a human editor before being given to news outlets. While Soccerbot only writes in Korean currently, it may surely start using other languages including English. (Edited by Nithya Nair)"
"Hyderabad: Ganesh idols have become dearer. The Goods and Service Tax (GST) on colours, fibre, foam, clay and scrap saw their prices skyrocketing by 30 per cent to 80 per cent.

Mr Sundar Kalakar, a well-known artist, who gets orders from all over the country, said, “I used to procure materials worth Rs 29 lakh every year. This time, most of the raw materials, like clay, plaster, foam, steel and fibre which were not taxed, is having a 18 per cent GST. Last year, we procured high quality stone plaster at Rs 1,700 per tonne which rose to Rs 2,000 per tonne this year. Similarly, the cost of fibre has increased from Rs 4,200 to Rs 5,800 for a 35-kg bag. The colour prices, too, rose by 50 per cent. Besides, the prices of paints have also increased. All these led to a rise in expenditure.”

S. Thirupathi Reddy, a Ganesh pandal organiser in Rajendra Nagar, said, “Last year, we purchased a 10-feet idol for Rs 5,500 and this year we had to shell out Rs 9,500 for the same idol. Besides, transportation charges have also increased,” he said.

Mr Ravinder Singh, a vendor at Jummeraat bazaar, said, “The prices have hiked between 30 per cent to 80 per cent this year.” Furthermore, the demolition drive on idol-making units in Dhoolpet, which used to house more than 100 big and 150 small units, also impacted the supply in the city.

Due to a land dispute, the Hyderabad Revenue Department demolished about 50 units six months ago, forcing artists to get fresh land on lease. These units used to start work six months before Vinayaka Chaturthi. Due to the demolitions, production by major units came down considerably."
"I did a film called Patang (2011), where 90% of the cast consisted of non-actors. Initially, I was not able to match their performance. NAWAZUDDIN SIDDIQUI, ACTOR From page 1 Nawazuddin, do you still feel the pressure before the release of your film, especially if you are the protagonist? Nawazuddin: There is absolutely no pressure with regards to the box office collections because the budget of this film isn’t that much. I feel we will recover the cost easily. A film like Haraamkhor (2015) was made in `70 lakhs but bought by an online streaming platform for a crore, so we earned more. The problem arises when people deliberately spread the word that the film’s budget was higher, so that it looks like a flop. When it comes to your performance, does it matter who your co-star is? Nawazuddin: What scares me the most is if my co-star is a non-actor. For example, I did a film called Patang (2011), where 90% of the cast consisted of non-actors. Initially, I was not able to match their performance. So for 15 days, I stayed with them and studied them, which benefitted me immensely. I learnt a lot about the craft because of them. I feel, when you are honest, the technicality does not matter. Your co-stars admit that they want to be well-prepared while working with you. Do you take it as a compliment? Nawazuddin: I have no idea what to say about this, but yes, I do feel they come with some expectations. I do not take any actor for granted. You are reaching the audience through the camera, so you have to be honest. Bidita was it difficult for you to pick up the dialect of the character, considering you are from Kolkata? Bidita: Yes, it was a bit difficult, which is why I did not improvise at all (laughs). The dialogues written were delivered the way it was supposed to. There were quite a few local actors; I observed them and tried to grasp their accent. Nawazuddin sir is from Uttar Pradesh and he helped me a lot. Jatin, this is your first big break. How nervous were you? Jatin: Of course, there was performance anxiety. I was unable to sleep for three days before the shoot began. But Nawazuddin sir helped me a great deal and he rehearsed with me before I gave my first shot. He asked me how I wanted to do the scene, and we began improvising, which was relaxing and calmed my nerves. Shraddha, how was your experience of shooting for this film? Shraddha: I play a character called Yasmin, a struggling Bhojpuri actress. She is unlike me as she is loud and has a lot of layers. It was a great experience for me. I was a little intimidated by Nawazuddin sir. My look in this film is a bit like a female version of Govinda. Personally, I did not relate to this character, which is why it was more difficult for me. Team Cafe (Transcribed by Navneet Vyasan)"
"I gnoring domestic requests that he postpone his trip to India due to the floods in Nepal, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba along with a high-level delegation arrived in New Delhi on a five-day official visit on Wednesday. This is his first visit abroad after assuming office in June 2017, and he is expected call on President Ram Nath Kovind and meet PM Narendra Modi and other senior Indian leaders.

Apart from official engagements in New Delhi, he will also visit Hyderabad, Tirupati and Bodh Gaya before returning to Kathmandu. The visit comes at a time when various events have led to strained relations between the two nations. Nepal’s Parliament has asked Deuba to strongly raise the issue of floods in the country, which Kathmandu believes has been caused by India building more than 15 embankments near the border with Nepal.

Deuba is also expected to demand movement on the 6,000 MW Pancheshwar hydropower project that was signed in February 1996, but has not moved beyond the paperwork despite numerous meetings. The joint project envisions a dam built jointly on the Mahakali River, which forms large stretches of the border between the two nations, and is expected to generate power for both nations.

Deuba is also under pressure to raise the dispute over Lipulekh Pass, a tri-junction boundary point between India, Nepal and China, near Kalapani, a disputed border area between Nepal and India. Delhi, already facing an unprecedented military standoff with China at Doklam along the Bhutan border, is worried about Beijing’s aggressive attempts to woo Nepal and other neighbours.

Two weeks ago, Nepal’s Deputy Prime Minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara had declared that “Nepal will not get dragged into this or that side in the Doklam border dispute,” and urged India and China to use “peaceful diplomatic means” to resolve the dispute. Though Doklam is unlikely to be raised during Deuba’s trip, this is one visit that China will be watching with interest."

The Union government on Wednesday clarified that selling of space for advertisements in print media would attract 5 and 18 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST), depending on the terms of the contract between the newspaper, advertisement agency and the client.



If the advertisement agency works on principal-to-principal basis, that is, buys space from the newspaper and sells such space for advertisement to clients on its own account, that is, as a principal, it would be liable to pay GST at the rate of 5 per cent on the full amount charged by advertisement agency from the client, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.

For example, if a newspaper sells a unit of space worth Rs 100 to an advertisement agency for Rs 85 (after a trade discount of Rs 15) and the advertisement agency sells the same unit of space to client at Rs 100, then the newspaper would be liable to pay GST at the rate of 5 per cent on Rs 85 (i.e. Rs 4.25) and the advertisement agency would be liable to pay GST on Rs 100 (i.e. Rs 5) and may utilise input tax credit (ITC) of Rs 4.25.



On the other hand, if the advertisement agency sells space for advertisement as an agent of the newspaper on commission basis, it would be liable to pay GST at the rate of 18 per cent on the sale commission it receives from the newspaper. ITC of GST paid on such sale commission would be available to newspaper, the statement said.



So, for example, if an advertisement agency sells unit of space to the client not on its own account but on account of newspaper for Rs 100 and receives commission of Rs 15 for such sale from the newspaper.

In such a case, the advertisement agency shall be liable to pay GST at the rate of 18 per cent on the sales commission of Rs 15 (i.e Rs 2.7), ITC of which shall be available to newspaper for payment of GST at the rate of 5 per cent on Rs 100 (value of space for advertisement sold by the newspaper).



However, if the advertisement agency supplies any service other than selling of space for advertisement, such as designing or drafting the advertisement and such supply is not a part of any composite supply, the same would be liable to tax at the rate of 18 per cent.



If such supplies are part of any composite supply, the rate applicable for the principal supply shall apply, it said.

"Icame by a curious article in The Hindu a few days earlier, which quoted an unnamed home ministry official as saying that the ministry had “decided to rescind the power to invoke” the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 or AFSPA, in Manipur and Assam.. That’s lovely, but the validating bureaucratese—such phrasing is the lifeblood of government—requires interpretation.. Don’t get me wrong. Revocation of such powers would be great, but it should not be misconstrued as the revocation or repeal of AFSPA itself, the long-time demand of human rights organizations and activists, and several government committees, most notably the Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy Committee in 2005, and in 2007 by the Administrative Reforms Commission headed by Veerappa Moily.. Little has moved to temper the law that permits the armed forces impunity and immunity and massive extrajudicial reach. It is now quite clear that any central government—led either by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Congress, or any other party—will be reluctant to repeal AFSPA. The piece of legislation is simply too attractive a device of command and control. (It is currently applied in all of Manipur except the municipal limits of the capital Imphal, to the entirety of Nagaland, parts of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, and a sliver of Meghalaya along its border with Assam. An AFSPA cousin, if you will, is applied to Jammu and Kashmir.). The mention of Manipur and Assam is interesting as the BJP is in the government in both the states, and for all practical purpose a straight line of security diktat extends from New Delhi to Imphal and Dispur, Assam’s administrative capital.. Moreover, for the central government to devolve the power completely to states, the Act may need to be amended.. To apply AFSPA, a particular area has to first be declared “disturbed”.. Section 3 of the Act defines the “powers” to declare it so, if the area “is in such a disturbed or dangerous condition that the use of armed forces in aid of the civil power is necessary, the governor of that state or the administrator of that Union territory or the Central Government, as the case may be, may by notification in the Official Gazette, declare the whole or such part of such state or Union territory to be a disturbed area”.. To technically “rescind” its power, the words “Central Government” mentioned twice in that particular section, will have to go. Will it?. And, even if it does, will state governments really be free to extend, limit or jettison AFSPA as they wish? As far as Manipur goes, BJP chief minister Nongthombam Biren Singh chaired a cabinet meeting in late May, a little over two months after taking office, and extended the state’s “disturbed area” status quo by another six months—the time limit for periodic review. As AFSPA is already in force, it becomes a procedural matter of a bureaucrat issuing an order of extension.. But the decision is, in reality, taken by the chief minister in consultation with his cabinet colleagues and administrative, police and intelligence officials; and not infrequently in consultations with the commanding general or senior officer of the local armed forces garrison.. It is no different for Singh’s colleague in Assam, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal.. Such consultation is precisely how Tripura jettisoned AFSPA. On 27 May 2015, the state cabinet led by Communist Party of India (Marxist) chief minister Manik Sarkar decided to remove the Act from the state, after consultations with central government agencies—significantly, a central government run by political opponent BJP—and the armed forces.. Tripura’s decision to remove AFSPA was practical and integrationist. The state’s rebellions, like most rebellions in north-east India, were and are a direct consequence of political and administrative apathy—which fuels wars for identity, dignity and development.. Brutal policing, deft politics, and some development reduced insurgency in Tripura to a trickle. Over the years, the state has also seen itself as a regional geo-economic player. AFSPA, a brutal, alienating law, detracted from such a future.. It would detract from the future of Manipur and Assam too, because by themselves, more than as pieces in India’s Look-East or Act-East jigsaws, the people of these states wish to ditch the economy of conflict and embrace the economy of peace.. More than Assam, I would watch which way the AFSPA winds blow in Manipur.. It remains the state with the greatest number of rebel groups, mostly resident in Myanmar, and with a flourishing narcotics food chain linking security personnel, politicians, administrators and rebels that thrives on violence and cynical practice..

The tragic death of scores of children recently at the BRD Medical College hospital in Gorakhpur has reopened the discussion on India’s weak state capacity. In the last 70 years, the Indian state has clearly failed at delivering quality education and public health to its citizens. This raises a couple of troubling questions: 1) Why have democratic institutions not been able to generate sufficient pressure upon successive governments to deliver better health and education services? 2) Why has high economic growth in the last quarter-century not created an improvement in government provision of services?

The work of Monica Das Gupta of the Maryland Population Research Center has been quoted in this newspaper earlier in the context of the first question. But it is worth reiterating her arguments because they are crucial to finding the answers to the second question as well. In general, democratic institutions in India have negatively affected the provision of public health because—as Das Gupta writes—“electorates typically prefer public funds to be used to provide private goods (such as medical care), rather than public goods (such as sanitary measures to protect the health of the population as a whole).” In fact, she notes, the non-democratic regimes of East Asia were more successful in delivering quality public health services. Going further, Das Gupta blames “elite capture” which helps divert public funds meant for primary healthcare towards provision of tertiary medical services.

This brings us to the second question. It should be noted that there is not much evidence to link higher economic growth to better institutions. The causality is better established in the other direction. However, there is some evidence that higher economic growth may actually lead to degradation in governance quality. A 2002 paper by Daniel Kaufmann and Aart Kraay came to this very conclusion and the duo speculated that “elite influence and state capture” might be the reason that a virtuous cycle between economic growth and quality of governance doesn’t manifest.

If neither democratic institutions nor economic growth guarantees higher state capacity, what does? A deeper understanding of state capacity itself would be required to reach some conclusions. In his 16th UNU-WIDER (United Nations University-World Institute for Development Economics Research) annual lecture, Lant Pritchett of Harvard University goes into the details of the state capacity question. The key for us here is the distinction that Pritchett draws between “thick accountability” and “thin accountability”. For an organization, thin accountability is based on measures of objective performance and is judicable. On the other hand, thick accountability comprises justification of organizational actions to internal culture and external stakeholders.

For example, thin accountability will have parameters like the attendance record of teachers in schools and nurses in hospitals, and thick accountability will involve quality of diagnosis of a patient and the learning outcome of students. It is evident that an organization with weak capacity may well be able to deliver on thin accountability metrics but will always struggle with thick accountability.

Setting the curriculum for schools is, therefore, something states with a weak capacity will be able to deliver much better than ensuring teaching standards. In healthcare, similarly, tertiary healthcare service is easier than making doctors deliver in primary healthcare centres. Now, one can clearly see that both weak electoral demand and weak state capacity are reinforcing the same consequence, which, in healthcare for instance, is prioritization of tertiary medical services over primary healthcare.

The actual puzzle is that the same Indian state which struggles at primary healthcare and education is able to organize the world’s largest elections, enrol billions of people in a biometric Aadhaar programme, and send Mangalyaan to orbit Mars—the only nation to do it in the first attempt. Pritchett’s insights can explain most of these isolated achievements. The parameters of accountability in these cases—number of voters in elections, number of registrants in Aadhaar, the cost of an orbiter mission—are objective and judicable. Moreover, these organizations have all been driven by a mission-oriented focus. The culture of internal accountability in a mission-oriented organization is much better. In a 2005 paper, Timothy Besley and Maitreesh Ghatak established that matching the missions of citizens (principal) with those of the public bureaucracies (agent) reduces the need for pecuniary incentives for the latter. In any case, incentives can work only when, as Pritchett says, the contingent facts in the incentive formula are judicable.

What makes a good Reserve Bank of India governor or a good Isro (Indian Space Research Organisation) chairman is not amenable to judicable facts but the two organizations have still been able to consistently get capable and worthy leaders. The same goes, broadly speaking, for judges in the Supreme Court and high courts. This is, at least partly, the result of a successful infusion of a sense of mission in these organizations. But the engendering of such attitudes in an organization takes time and is not always successful. This will involve creating a few initial successes, replicating, repeating and multiplying them. And then crafting organizational narratives around those successes. The governments at the centre and in the states should embark on this task with a “missionary” focus.

"Image: ShutterstockBack in high school in India, I had no idea that data science could save lives.I wanted to be a doctor because I wanted to make a difference. And, what better way to make a difference than by saving lives?That was my thinking until they told me I would have to cut up cadavers to become a doctor. That ended that. I would become a statistician and other people would be the ones who would make the ultimate difference by keeping us all alive.Or so I thought.Now I know better. I shouldn’t have overlooked the power of data to solve problems and find solutions.Thousands of people die every year from a common, but devastating, bacterial infection they get when hospitalized. It’s called Clostridium Difficile 101 (or CDIFF for short). In the United States alone, around 500,000 people are infected every year and, of those, 29,000 die from it. Many more succumb to the disease around the world.It’s an ugly infection, putting the most vulnerable at risk of dying from dehydration brought on by seemingly endless bouts of diarrhea. People get infected when antibiotics wipe out their good, infection-fighting bacteria. The elderly, young, and those with compromised immune systems are most at risk. But anyone can get it.So how are data scientists like those on my Data and Decision Sciences team in Microsoft IT able to help?We’re working with hospitals to predict when a patient is at risk of being infected by CDIFF. That might sound simple, but knowing the answer to this question can help hospitals take life-saving precautions to help at-risk patients.When a patient is brought into an Emergency Room, we use artificial intelligence-driven modeling to assess their risk. This assessment scores them on how likely they are to get infected by CDIFF and, if they are likely to get it, how likely it is to lead to death.It scores them for age, medical history, antibiotics usage, and a long list of other factors. We’re working with two hospitals in the Midwest region of the United States to refine our model. And, using old data, we’re right 85 percent of the time. That number is gradually climbing as we pour more data and insights into the model, allowing it to learn and become more accurate. We’re hoping to get it into the mid- to upper-90s percent range and then make it broadly available for all hospitals to use.Assessing an individual person’s risk enables hospitals to adopt procedures for taking care of these high-risk patients, costly precautions that can be reserved for those at the most risk.But there is a human side too.CDIFF is spread easily. Say, for instance, when patients are casual with their hygiene, or when hospital personnel do not remember to wear fresh gloves or wash their hands as thoroughly or as regularly as they should. The story changes, however, when you can look at a patient’s chart and see that she or he is at “high risk” of dying if you aren’t as vigilant as possible. It’s human nature for people to do everything they can to protect that person.And by now you are probably wondering: if data science can help hospitals fend off CDIFF, what else can it do?Lots.We’re working with other hospitals to find other ways to help them save lives. Some of the things we’re working on are not as exciting. For instance, forecasting when a hospital will run short on beds is dry stuff, but it can be crucially important when it comes to making sure there are enough of them available during a crisis. Also not flashy is predicting which patients are going be re-admitted for the same problem in less than 30 days. Nonetheless, getting ahead of these re-admissions can save hospitals millions of dollars and keep patient costs down.We’re working hard to find new ways that data can do what I once thought was impossible, to save lives, and as you can imagine, lots of other cool stuff.Learn more about the power of data analytics and machine learning by reading about how we’re using data to help save kids who are in danger of dropping out of school and how we are using data to help manage our buildings at Microsoft.

"Imagine a city with a little over 2,800 lakes, half a dozen rivulets, and a river cutting through its topography with well laid orchards and green belts interspersed with monuments of historic importance.This city of pristine water and picturesque gardens is our own Hyderabad seven decades ago. Today we have lost this heritage because of unchecked encroachments and ever-increasing pollution taking a heavy toll on the beautiful Hyderabad of yore. Over the decades, Hyderabadis failed to pass on the aquatic and environmental heritage left behind by the Kakatiyas, the Qutub Shahis and the Asaf Jahis to the posterity . Sadly, this generation of Hyderabadis are not fortunate to enjoy the serenity and grandeur of the environment heritage created by the ancestors. All the lakes, rivulets and the Musi, which were filled with crystal clear water once, today carry sewage and harmful wastes of all description. The city had over 2,800 lakes till 70 years ago. Some of them have been filled up with building debris for reclamation of land while others were wantonly allowed to dry up to make encroachments easier. Most of the water bodies in Hyderabad are not just aquatic structures. They are replete with history, each having its own glorious tale to tell. With the gradual death of the aquatic and environment heritage of Hyderabad, city's soil and groundwater too are polluted robbing the historic city of its once magnificent water bodies that not only quenched the thirst and provided food in the form of fish, but also served as entertainment spots for the residents. The Musi, once the lifeline of Hyderabad, is dead for all practical purposes.With encroachments coming up on its banks and in the upstream the flood flow into the river in Hyderabad has come down drastically .The river was once known for its flash floods including the mega floods of 1820 and 1908. The last grand flood the river witnessed was in September 1970 and to a lesser extent in 2015. Over 20 major reservoirs quenched the thirst of people till 50 years ago but now only two ­ Osmansagar and Himayatsagar ­ contain water that can be consumed by human beings after treat ment. The rest are unfit even after treatment. Major tanks like Ma Sahiba Tank (Masab Tank), Mir Jumla Tank, Goshamahal Tank now exist only in history books, so are hundreds of small reservoirs. The beauty of the hydrological system adopted by the erstwhile rulers was such that excess flood water from one tank overflowed into another through natural or artificial streams. These streams are either dead or have become municipal drains. The Hussainsagar built by eminent engineer Hussain Shah Wali during the Qutub Shahi period about 400 years ago once had an area of about 30 sq km. Mir Alam Tank constructed by prime minister Abul Qasim Syed Mir Alam in 1806 now contains natural and artificial reproductive hormones. The irreparable damage to the aquatic heritage of Hyderabad is frequently felt in the form of flooding of residential areas during heavy rains, shortage of drinking water and loss of fish and bird populations."
"IMRANAHMED SIDDIQUI New Delhi, Aug. 23: Muslim leaders and organisations yesterday largely welcomed the Supreme Court verdict against the instant talaq but expressed fear that the Narendra Modi government might use it as a launch pad to bring in a uniform civil code. They pilloried the Centre's avowal of a pro- Muslimwomen stance in the instant talaq debate as "" political gimmick and hypocrisy"", asking what Modi had done for the women riot victims of 2002 or the widows of the recent cow vigilante lynchings. "" The Prime Minister has no moral right to talk of justice for Muslim women. Where was he when Muslim women were being raped and pregnant women's wombs were being ripped apart during the 2002 Gujarat riots, when he was the chief minister?"" asked Kamal Farooqui, member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board. He was guarded about the verdict. "" The top court has not banned talaq as such; it has only outlawed the instant talaq ,"" he said. "" In our affidavit to the apex court, we too had submitted that Shariat law did not sanction this controversial practice of instant divorce."" Farooqui said the instant talaq accounted for a minuscule proportion of divorces among Muslims. While criticising those who practice the instant talaq , the law board had told the apex court that it was against the government or the judiciary intervening in personal law. Navaid Ahmed, president of the All India Majlis- e- Mushawarat, an umbrella body of Muslim organisations, hailed the verdict. "" I welcome the judgment as it has commented only on the instant talaq and not on Muslim personal laws. We fear that this government is trying to push through a common Hindu code in the guise of a uniform civil code,"" he said. Abdul Hameed Noumani, general secretary of the All India Muslim Morcha, too welcomed the judgment: "" Every sensible Indian Muslim wanted a ban on the instant talaq as it is a sin."" He, however, accused the Modi government of playing politics with the issue. "" Modiji has overnight become a champion of Muslim women but he had never said anything comforting to the widows of Pehlu Khan and Mohammed Akhlaque, who were lynched by gau rakshaks ,"" Noumani said. "" If he had really been so concerned about Muslim women, he would have ensured justice for the rape survivors of Gujarat and Muzaffarnagar."" Ahmed said it would be a Herculean task for the government to implement the verdict on the ground and demanded an awareness campaign against "" the evils of the instant talaq "". Masoom Moradabadi, editor of the Urdu daily Jadid Khabar , asked why the government had been so worried about the instant talaq and not the lynching of Muslims. "" It's a shrewd political agenda to raise insignificant issues to divert people's attention from the real issues,"" he said. Moradabadi said Modi had never visited the relief camps sheltering Muslim women after the 2002 riots. "" Rather, he greeted them with barbs, describing them as child- producing factories,"" he said, alluding to Modi's dig of "" Hum panch , hamare pachees ( We are five, we produce 25)"". Abul Qasim Nomani, vicechancellor of the Darul Uloom Deoband, the country's oldest seminary, said the government had politicised the debate on the instant talaq "" to attack Islam and attack Muslims"". Zafaryab Jilani, member of the personal law board, too suspected a "" conspiracy to impose a uniform civil code"". "" The government shouldn't misuse the Supreme Court order to interfere in personal laws. We accept the judgment but will examine the issues of its implementation and work to resolve them,"" he said. Ahmed dismissed the BJP claim that the government's stand against the instant talaq had won it votes from Muslim women in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. "" It's a lie: there was no such inclination among Muslim women,"" he said."

"In 2012, when we had just about set-up our insurance broking business, I received an email from a Chandigarh-based exporter. “Do you know what comprehensive general liability insurance is?” he asked. His American client was insisting on this as a precondition to doing business. The local branches of insurers, banks and sales persons had told him that this was a western concept not available in India. Last week, 5 years later, I had a feeling of déjà vu when another, larger Delhi-based exporter, called with exactly the same question.. Liability remains a hazy concept not understood by the very people most exposed to these risks. Unless the risks are better understood, insuring them remains a distant objective. Swiss Re, in its Sigma report on Liability in Asia, estimates the Indian liability insurance market to be under Rs2,000 crore and just about 2.2% of the general insurance market. This puts India in the 9th position in Asia in terms of proportion and 5th in terms of absolute size. The annual growth of this product, over the past several years, has been slower than the industry. One reason for poor awareness and take-up rates is that claims paid have been few, despite litigation increasing rapidly. Claims as a proportion of premium have been about 40%, which is far lower than in other lines of business such as health and motor insurance. However, this will change rapidly as litigation continues to rise, more people buy this insurance and buyers understand how to claim.. Liability risk refers to actions for which you can be held accountable, should something go wrong. The insurance does not remove the risk of litigation but pays for your defence and penalties. There are many liabilities you face but four, in particular, are important to know. These are: risks arising because of disgruntled customers; accountability for issues in the companies you work in or are on the Board of; injuries to people on your premises or using your products; and accidents involving your workers. These risks are real and ever increasing.. Some professions are more vulnerable to irate customers. These include doctors, chartered accountants, advisers, architects and builders. Clients file cases if a medical treatment does not work out, tax advice turns out poor, constructed buildings have flaws, or delivery is delayed. A professional indemnity insurance covers such risks that come out of a perceived deficiency or negligence.. Many of us work in companies or are directors. The more senior you are, the more accountable you will be held for the mistakes. The Companies Act, 2013, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, broaden the statutory responsibilities of directors and senior executives and also create provisions for penalties. These penalties can cross over company boundaries and encroach on your personal assets, particularly for directors. A case that I am familiar with involves a bank that sued a director for a loan default related to his company. When the director died, the liability was transferred to the heirs who had nothing to do with the loan or the company. Another case, described publicly, involved a start-up entrepreneur jailed because his company had allegedly not paid some vendor dues. A ‘directors and officer’s liability’ insurance protects you in such situations.. You are exposed to third-party litigation if you run a business that has outsiders visit your premises or manufacture items that could hurt someone, even inadvertently. Restaurants, factories, exporters, makers of consumer goods, auto-component manufacturers and many others face this threat. This can be insured by a ‘comprehensive general liability’ cover, the insurance that I referred to at the beginning of this column.. Finally, if you are constructing a home or have a business that employs workers, then you are accountable for accidents they have at work. In cases of a death or disability, the courts decide the compensation under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923. This is an unlimited liability, which means there is no maximum level set for compensation. Such risks are insured by the “workers’ compensation” insurance.. Ask the following basic questions when you buy liability insurance. How much sum assured is needed? Will the insurer pay even if you lose the legal case? Will the insurer provide you advice on fighting your case? Will claims that may come up years after your action be insured?. These questions are difficult to answer. Take the first one on the right level of sum assured. I asked this of a senior liability insurer who told me that you know you should have bought more if your insurance runs out. He was being facetious, of course, but the question remained unanswered. For professionals working on their own, a sum assured of Rs1 crore is a good place to start. As your business grows, this can be increased. For most liability insurances, this will cost under Rs20,000. If you lose the case, unless the damage is deliberate, the insurer will pay the claim. Practically, cases take a long time to settle so insurers may even press for early settlement. In liability claims, insurers are closely involved in your case. Sometimes they may suggest lawyers or even a line of defence. Finally, do remember these claims can come in years after an incident. Insurers will pay these claims provided you have renewed your insurance every year. As in your personal health and term insurance, timely renewals are key.. A few months ago I was at the family vet, when a young girl asked if our dog bites. “Not at all,” said the vet, overconfidently I thought. But then I recalled that the first liability insurance we sold was to the vet—to insure him for situations where someone got bitten in his clinic.. Kapil Mehta is co-founder, SecureNow.in"

"In a decision that will touch the lives of all 134 crore Indians, a nine-judge Supreme Court bench will pronounce judgment on Thursday on the complicated issue of whether the privacy of an individual was a part of hisher inviolable fundamental rights? According to SC sources, there will be six judgments on the issue by the bench. The question about the constitutional status of right to privacy arose in a bunch of petitions, led by retired HC judge K S Puttaswamy , which had, in 2012, challenged the UPA government's decision to introduce the biometric dataenabled Aadhaar ID for citizens. This question was referred to a five-judge Constitution bench on August 11, 2015. The five-judge bench, led by Chief Justice J S Khehar, met on July 18 to decide the issue, but was told by the Centre that the strength of the bench was inadequate as an eightjudge bench in the M P Sharma case in 1954, and a sixjudge bench in the Kharak Singh case in 1962, had ruled that right to privacy was not a fundamental right. The bench was quick to refer the matter to a nine-judge bench, which began hearing arguments from July 19, and concluded hearing on August 2, after a lively debate involving renowned lawyers to greenhorns. The Centre, through attorney general K K Venugopal, had said, “Privacy , even if assumed to be a fundamental right, consists of a large number of sub-species... It will be constitutionally impermissible to declare each and every in stance of privacy a fundamental right. Privacy has varied connotations when examined from different aspects of liberties. If the SC wants to declare it a fundamental right, then it probably has to determine separately the various aspects of privacy and the extent of violation that could trigger a constitutional remedy .“ This argument presented to the bench of Justices Khehar, J Chelameswar, S A Bobde, R K Agrawal, R F Nariman, A M Sapre, D Y Chandrachud, Sanjay K Kaul and S Abdul Nazeer the constitutional complications intrinsic to privacy when its width and play is examined through the crosswires of fundamental rights. Acknowledging the challenge involved, Justice Chandrachud, on the last day of hearing, tentatively outlined a proposal -a three-tier, graded fundamental right status to privacy . “The first zone could be the most intimate zone of privacy concerning marriage, sexuality, relation with family, and law should frown upon any intrusion. The State could still intrude into this intimate zone in extraordinary circumstances provided it met stringent norms. Second would be the private zone, which involves parting of personal data by use of credit card, social network platforms, I-T declarations. In this sphere, personal data... ...will be used only for the purpose for which it is shared by an individual. Third is the public zone, where privacy protection requires minimal regulation. Here, personal data shared will not mean the right to privacy is surrendered. Individual will retain his privacy to body and mind,“ he had said."
"In a historic judgement, the Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that Right to Privacy is finally a part of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution to Indian citizens under Article 21.

A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice of India JS Khehar, has unanimously declared Right to Privacy as part of the Right to Life and Liberty assured by the Article 21 of the Indian constitution.

This verdict is on par with petitioners’ argument which had earlier opposed an SC bench’s observation -- that Right to Privacy was not “absolute”— by positing that the right was embedded within Right to Life and Liberty.

The current judgment has overruled previous SC judgments that did not hold the said right as fundamental. Formerly, a six-judge bench (Kharak Singh, 1962) and an eight-judge bench (MP Sharma, 1954) had ruled against the right being a fundamental right under the Constitution.

The judgment has not addressed issues of Aadhaar and Section 377 and other issues peripheral to the Right to Privacy debate. It did not say anything about citizens having the right to not share their biometric details, said senior advocate and petitioner Prashant Bushan in an interaction with the media after the verdict.

He also told the media that the judgment would be an impediment for the government as it has not considered Right to Privacy as a fundamental right.

The Aadhaar Act passed in 2016 requires social welfare schemes and income tax returns be claimed through Aadhaar number. Senior Advocate Bhushan said that such laws would be considered by a separate bench on grounds of whether they fell under “reasonable restrictions"" which could be imposed on fundamental rights by the legislature.

According to Bhushan, Aadhaar use in the case of social welfare schemes could be made possible with reasonable restrictions to the right to privacy. The government would need to know the details of people availing these schemes. Bhushan also said that if restrictions were introduced to people’s travels and purchases, as per the senior lawyer, they would be “unreasonable”.

A nine-judge bench, comprising Chief Justice JS Khehar and Justices J Chelameswar, SA Bobde, RK Agrawal, Rohinton Nariman, AM Sapre, DY Chandrachud, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and S Abdul Nazeer, were hearing arguments raised by over 20 petitions questioning the infringement of people’s privacy by the Aadhaar rules that mandate collection of biometric information.

On July 19, when the SC had observed the Right to Privacy was not absolute and courts could not stop the State from putting reasonable restrictions, Senior Counsel Gopal Subramanium had argued, “Privacy is a broader concept and data sharing is only one aspect of privacy. Privacy is about the freedom of thought, conscience and individual autonomy and none of the fundamental rights can be exercised without assuming a certain sense of privacy”. He added that the State was under a positive obligation to safeguard the fundamental rights of its citizens.

The Aadhaar Act passed in 2016 has compelled the citizens of India to register for an Aadhaar number and link it with all important details such as bank accounts, PAN Card, tax returns, mobile numbers and the like."
"In a landmark and historic judgment, a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court today unanimously declared right to privacy a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution, setting off far-reaching implications in terms of law and citizenship ( LIVE UPDATES ). A nine-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar ruled that ""right to privacy is an intrinsic part of Right to Life and Personal Liberty under Article 21 and entire Part III of the Constitution"". The nine judges also unanimously overruled the two earlier judgements of the apex court that right to privacy is not protected under the Constitution: the MP Sharma verdict of 1950 and that of Kharak Singh of 1960. The contentious issue of privacy had emerged when the apex court was dealing with a batch of petitions challenging the Centre's move to make Aadhaar card mandatory for availing the benefits of various social welfare schemes. There has, however, been no Supreme Court ruling specifically on Aadhaar today. The verdict, however, could derail the world's largest biometric identification programme that the government has been pushing for a while.

"In a major blow to the investigating agencies probing murder cases of rationalists Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare, the Bombay High Court (HC) on Wednesday said that the killings of both the rationalists were “well-planned” and the perpetrators had organisational backup.The HC also asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate beyond their current line of probe and use modern technology to trace the perpetrators’ whereabouts. The bench commented after examining their probe reports submitted by the state Crime Investigation Department (CID) and the CBI.After hearing the matter presented by the family members, the bench of justices SC Dharmadhikari and Vibha Kankanwadi also suggested that there was a “clear nexus” between the two killings.The bench observed that certain organisations must be backing them, helping them financially that is why there is no knowledge of any of the absconding accused.Referring to Sarang Akolkar and Vinay Pawar, the two men identified by the CBI were still to be traced, the bench pointed out that there is a clear nexus between the two murders. These accused must have some roots in the society.Justice Dharmadhikari said, “It is impossible for someone to remain in hiding for so long in today’s time. There is a need to use modern technology and also conduct searches in other states.”The bench directed the two probe agencies to take note of its suggestions and submit fresh progress reports by the next date of hearing on September 13.Both the probe agencies, meanwhile, said they were hunting for the killers.Talking to Pune Mirror, Hamid Dabholkar said, “We will submit an affidavit, listing our demand that the state home secretary and the CBI director be made directly accountable for the probe.”Dabholkar was shot dead on August 20, 2013 in Pune while he was on a morning walk.Pansare was shot at on February 16, 2015 in Kolhapur and succumbed to his injuries on February 20 that year.The high court has been hearing petitions filed by the kin of the two seeking court monitored investigations in both the cases."
"In a major move, the Telangana government has decided to take up the comprehensive land survey and settlement from September 15. The massive program will be held for one month in which more than 10,000 government staff will be deployed. Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao held a high level meeting at Pragati Bhavan on Wednesday .The marathon 9-hour meeting finalised the road map for the land survey . “The state will be divided into 1100 units and 3,600 groups each consist a revenue and agriculture officer along with the village farmers' association representative. They will tour the village and scrutiny the records and set right the anomalies. The local MLA, MLC and MP and other public representatives will also associate with the program,“ said a senior official in the revenue department. The chief minister directed the revenue officials to ensure 100 per cent clean land records in all villages which he opined would spur the industrial activity in the rural areas. He pointed that the previous land survey to ok place during the Nizam's rule in 1932-36. “After that no survey was done. Since the land records are not maintained properly there are disputes and litigation. So we have launched the survey .Once the survey is completed here, it will become a live example for other states to follow. We will prepare a detailed project report on the issue and will be sent to the Centre,“ the CM said. In 10875 villages in the State, the survey will be do ne with village as a unit. Officials will stay put in the villages and with the cooperation from farmers will conduct the survey , update the records online. New passbooks will be given after the rectification of the records. The registrations of land will also be reformed by computerizing all the existing data. Revenue officials who attended the meeting were instructed to complete mutation on the day of the registration. The formation of farmer association coordination committees will start from September 1 and will complete by September 9 and from September 10, the mandal level committee will be formed. The state government wanted to complete the process by December end by which time, the computerization and online registration process will also get completed."

"In a rare show of assertive ness, some leading domes tic institutional investors (DIIs), including top mutual fund (MF) houses in the country, want Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani to be back on the board of the company .They believe that Nilekani can steer Infosys out of troubled waters following the exit of CEO Vishal Sikka. In a letter to the board members of Infosys, top officials of leading fund houses and insurance companies -including ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company and Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, among others -said that Nilekani should be brought back in an appropriate capacity . “This would be one of the first instances when domestic institutional investors have proactively expressed their concern on a corporate governance issue concerning a large company ,“ Shriram Subramanian, MD, InGovern Research Services, said. Insurance companies and MFs, which together own about 21% in Infosys, have seen the value of their holdings fall by around $840 million (Rs 5,400 crore) in the days following Sikka's exit. MF officials, speaking on condition of anonymity , said Nilekani, 62, should return in a formal role for a limited period.“Nilekani can bring the company back to normalcy . He is one of the founders and age is also on his side,“ said an executive with a leading institutional investor which is a signatory to the letter sent to the board. “He has also been neutral -both towards the board and N R Narayana Murthy ,“ the MF executive added. The worried investors, both domestic and foreign, have floated several options in recent days, which included approaching the chairman of a large Indian conglomerate to explore a takeover of Infosys.However, the move didn't progress as the rival seemed to let the proposal pass. Similar informal moves were afoot in the recent years, when Infosys, once India's IT bellwether, was beset with succession-related performance issues. But with Nilekani returning, investors are bound to repose their faith in the company , for now. “This is a company with good track record and a great balance sheet. Nilekani is competent, though we know that his return will be a short-term arrangement. Infosys needs to identify a professional CEO soon,“ said another investor. There are others who believe Nilekani's tenure (to have any real impact) should be for three years at least. There are bankers who suggest that consolidation among the large Indian IT services companies is inevitable in the medium term, as the sector grapples with growth headwinds and dramatically changing business landscape. In context, Nilekani's steering of Infosys in the near term will be closely watched. Infosys possibly has among the highest institutional investor holding in any Indian company by value. State-owned insurer LIC is the largest with a 7.03% stake."

Admission process for vacant seats will be now be held at college level.Till last year, offline admission round was conducted only in government and grant-in-aid colleges. From this year, self-finance colleges have been included. GP Vadodaria, Member Secretary of ACPC, said, “The government seats have been occupied. Vacancy is seen only in self-finance colleges. The Electronics and Communications (EC) branch has found least takers. However, in good colleges even the EC branch has filled up. After the end of admissions last year, over 28,000 seats had remained vacant. The final tally of vacant seats will be available only after college-level admission round.”Vadodaria commented, “Colleges will have to up the quality of education and placement. Students are aware and don’t want to waste four years of life if proper jobs and salaries are not available at the end of it. Colleges need to involve industry experts to improve quality of education.” Anil Suthar, Director of LJ Institute of Engineering and Technology, said, “Students do not opt for engineering as good jobs are difficult to secure. An engineering graduate, on average, gets between Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 salary per month. Most colleges don’t command respect from prospective employers as they lack even basic facilities and faculty.”"
"In the first such move by a venture capital fund, Sequoia Capital India has bought out a cosmetic firm Faces Canada from Everstone Capital. The deal is estimated to be $40 million in size with $10 million coming in as primary capital for the company while the rest will go to Everstone. Sequoia said it has signed definitive agreements for the acquisition of Faces Cosmetics Canada, along with its international subsidiaries and the brand Faces, from Indivision India Partners managed by private equity fund Everstone Capital. The existing management team led by Sharmili Rajput will continue to drive the business forward. “We are excited that there was an opportunity to buy high ownership, which allows Sequoia to provide greater operational support to the leadership team in key areas like marketing and distribution.

"In the midst of a drought and a looming water crisis, the Tamil Nadu government has set the stage to rejuvenate defunct small water bodies by reviving the age-old practice of ‘Kudimaramath’. Having witnessed the deleterious effects of the decay of innumerable small water bodies over the years, this timely initiative is better late than never.

At an estimated cost of Rs. 100 crore, ‘Kudimaramath’ envisages the rejuvenation of 1,519 out of 16,098 Public Works Department (PWD) tanks in 30 districts. Farmers across the State have welcomed the move on ‘Kudimaramath’ work of deepening of tanks, strengthening bunds, desilting supply channels and repairing sluices; they hope such an initiative will help store more water in tanks and ponds and will ensure adequate water supply even during drought.

However, farmers in the delta region are sceptical and wonder whether the exercise would deliver the desired results. The delta farmers allege that they were neither consulted on the works to be undertaken nor were they discussed at the gram sabhas. Farmers are also unhappy with the decision of the State government of taking up the repair works of PWD tanks and not considering those owned by panchayat unions.

Amidst such mixed responses from farmers, certain questions remain unanswered. Is the allocation of Rs. 100 crore enough to bring back small water bodies from the days of decay? Given the fact that during the past two decades several attempts have been made towards rejuvenating tanks, is this scheme worth the hype?

Rise and fall of Kudimaramath

Studies have shown that in ancient India water was managed through a system of patronage and community control through village councils in most parts of the country. This has been in vogue as a tradition at least in the southern part of the country for over centuries.

Historians have recorded that in Tamil Nadu, during the rule of Chola King Karikalan, certain parts of the Grand Anicut canal system were maintained by the government and were known as ‘sarkari’ and the lower parts maintained by farmers which were known as ‘Kudimaramath’ (people’s maintenance by donated labour).

Under the principle of ‘Kudimaramath’ the users were expected to contribute labour for the upkeep and repair of irrigation facilities from time to time. However, the institution of ‘Kudimaramath’ witnessed a gradual decay with the advent of the British rule as the management of tanks went from the knowledgeable neerkatti (or rural water managers) and a concerned community to a centralised channel namely PWD.

Post-Independence too, successive governments failed in their attempts to revive the ‘Kudimaramath’ works as they kept asserting their own powers and villagers’ obligations but not their rights.

Tanks and Tamil Nadu

Tanks have existed in India from time immemorial and have been an important source of irrigation especially in southern India. Tanks are less capital-intensive, capture the run-off resulting from the unpredictable monsoon rains, conserve water for multifarious uses like irrigated agriculture, drinking water for cattle and domestic uses and augment groundwater resources through sub-surface recharge.

However, over the years, tanks have been shrinking in size and number. Rapid urbanisation over the years has converted these community resources into dumping grounds in many places. Most of them have also been encroached, especially by municipalities and panchayats, as underlined in 16th report of the Standing Committee on Water Resources (2012-13) on “Repair, Renovation and Restoration of Water Bodies” published by the Union Ministry of Water Resources.

This report has also highlighted that out of 5.56 lakh tanks in the country, only 4.71 lakh tanks are in use. This implies a loss of about one million hectares of irrigation potential. Tanks irrigated more than 50 per cent of the agriculture lands in many States in India until 1950s.

However, the area irrigated by tanks fell drastically from 4.63 million hectares in 1960-61 to 1.98 million hectares in 2013-14. The scenario in Tamil Nadu is equally depressing. The state is home to about 41,127 tanks.

However, with the decline in the community maintenance of small water bodies, a large number of these tanks are silted up and supply and distribution channels are chocked. With the financial assistance of the European Economic Community (EEC), Nabard, Ford Foundation and World Bank, tank rehabilitation works have been carried out at different time points in the state.

But, unfortunately, the area under tank irrigation in the state has declined significantly from about 9.36 lakh hectares in 1960-61 to less than 5 lakh hectares in 2013-14. So where lies the problem?

Key to restore tanks

Climate experts have predicted that there will be fewer rainy days but in those days it would rain more, increasing the chances of flooding. Therefore, it is imperative to develop the capacity to store more water.

Some estimate suggests that the water storage capacity of about 40,000 tanks and other small water bodies is about 17 lakh million cubic feet, which is more than the storage level of all dams in the state.

Therefore, the cost-effective method of repairing, renovating and restoring the age-old tanks and other small water bodies should be given top priority.

The herculean task of infusing life to these ancient water storage structures can yield fruitful results only when the responsibility, authority and control over the development of water bodies are vested with the beneficiaries or the panchayats.

Most initiatives taken to renovate the tanks without the participation of farmers have miserably failed so far. When the responsibility of renovating tanks is given to panchayats, the accountability will be better as well.

"In wake of rising number of road accidents, the district administration has announced a drive to curb stray cattle menace on the roads. The LMC has been directed to take appropriate measures to catch stray cattle at the earliest. “Cases of road fatalities are on the rise. Over two dozen cases have been reported in recent past wherein the cause of accident was stray cattle,” said a senior administrative official. Chief veterinary officer Dr AK Rao, who is supervising the drive, said “We are out with the stray cattle catching plan that includes areas like Gomti Nagar, Qaiserbagh, Old Lucknow, Indira Nagar, Krishna Nagar, Alambagh, Charbagh and others.” So far, around 1,600 stray animals had been caught this financial year, he said. These animals were being sent to Kanha Upvan and other gaushalas in the city. “LMC should ensure that the drive is effectively carried out in areas prone to cattle menace. These include Arjunganj, Amausi, Old City and other areas,” Anil Garg, divisional commissioner had said recently."
"India is considering setting up remote air traffic control (ATC) towers to cut costs and overcome labour shortages, government sources said , as Prime Minister Narendra Modi looks to open dozens of regional airports to boost air travel. Remote monitoring allows traditional concrete control towers to be replaced with dozens of high resolution, infra-red cameras around runways that feed live images to screens in buildings far from the airport. The technology, used in countries including Australia, Canada, Ireland and Sweden, enables flights at multiple airports to be monitored from one location, reducing the need for air traffic controllers and physical towers at every airport. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has initiated a study on remote monitoring of flights, with a recommendation expected in September, one of the sources said. A decision to proceed could be a boost to companies like Sweden's Saab and Canada-based Searidge Technologies that are in talks with the airport regulator to bring the technology to India. ""India is one of the biggest opportunities in terms of the business potential,"" said Varun Singh, marketing director at Saab India, adding that it has held several discussions with the airport regulator. Searidge, which has set up remote digital towers in Hungary, Albania and Azerbaijan, said it has also presented its technology to the airport regulator. Air passenger traffic in India, the world's fourth biggest market, is growing at over 20 percent annually. Plans are underway to revive 50 regional airports in the next two years under a new scheme to boost connectivity between small cities. Low-cost carriers IndiGo, owned by InterGlobe, and SpiceJet have ordered dozens of new, small planes from European turboprop maker ATR and Canada's Bombardier to fly regional routes. REGULATOR KEY  The AAI is working with India's aviation safety watchdog, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), on the study and has sought information from countries where remote towers are in use, one source said. The plan hinges on DGCA's approval because remote tower technology is not standardised by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is still drawing up regulations. In the meantime, countries follow their own safety guidelines. ""Remote ATC is all the more needed for India given our vast area, low traffic at regional airports and the need to keep airfares low,"" said Amber Dubey, India head of aerospace and defence at consultancy KPMG. However, in several parts of India availability of reliable power and telecom connectivity are a challenge, said Dubey. While there have been power failures at ATC towers at two of India's biggest and busiest airports - Delhi and Mumbai - in the past, no incidents or accidents occurred as a result, according to local media reports. The bigger concern, however, is the transfer of data from the airport to the remote tower. An ATC official at India's airport regulator said they are yet to understand how the data transfer will work, what medium will be used and what the backup will be. ""If the (data transfer) medium goes blank, the airport will be cut off,"" said the official, who did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Controllers would also need to be trained to recognise and adapt to local conditions, including weather and topography, of multiple airports instead of just one, the source added. COSTS AND CHALLENGES The economics are appealing, however. The cost of servicing a regional airport with remote monitoring could be between 15-50 percent of building individual concrete towers, depending on how many airports are monitored, according to estimates by Saab. Savings also come from not having to station air traffic controllers, who are in short supply, in remote parts of the country for only a couple of flights a day. India has over 3,100 controllers but needs close to 3,900, and with more airports planned, demand is set to rise. ""With low traffic levels, controllers can monitor flights from multiple airports,"" said Neil Bowles, head of Air Traffic Management at Searidge. Saab, which has been operating remote towers in Sweden for two years and is in talks with about 10 other countries, said to ensure uninterrupted electricity it would equip the remote tower with backup supply similar to how it is done at airports.

"India’s are staging a from a last year, when the government suddenly cancelled most of the nation’s currency to crack down on the shadow economy.

Sales in Mumbai jumped to the highest in seven years in the second quarter, according to property consultancy Liases Foras Real Estate Rating & Research. Across eight major cities, sales gained 6 per cent from the previous quarter.

Homes costing less than Rs 50 lakh accounted for more than half the sales. Affordable homes, classified as below Rs 25 lakh, made up 17 per cent of sales. Of the eight cities, Mumbai recorded the greatest proportion of sales of this type of dwelling, at 24 per cent, data from Liases Foras showed.

Inventory levels, calculated based on how long it would take to sell stock, fell from 47 months in the previous quarter to 44 months. Buoyant sales came even after the government rolled out tighter rules for developers, including restrictions on pre-selling apartments before building approvals, and requirements for registering projects with a regulator.

Across the eight cities, sales rose 21 per cent in the first quarter after a 15 per cent decline in the fourth quarter.

“Despite it being a tough quarter for real estate after the introduction of the new law, sales have risen,” Pankaj Kapoor, the founder of Liases Foras, said by phone from Mumbai.

"Indian companies raised $1.89 billion from overseas markets last month, 57.5% more than a year ago, the Reserve Bank of India showed on Wednesday . They had, in comparison, borrowed $1.20 billion from overseas markets in July last year. The sources of funds raised in July this year included external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs). There was no data on credit offtake through rupee denominated bonds (RDBs) during the month as they were banned temporarily by capital markets regulator Sebi. “As rupee-denominated bonds issued by Indian corporates overseas are covered under Combined Corporate Debt Limit (CCDL), issuance of such bonds overseas shall temporarily cease, until the limit utilisation falls back to below 92%,“ Sebi had said in its order last month. The ban came in less than an year since the RBI started giving data on RDB borrowings from September 2016. The RBI data showed that $1.24 billion was raised via the automatic route last month, while the rest of $650 million came through approval route. Rural Electrification Corporation took the approval route of ECB to raise $450 million and $200 million in separate tranches of 10 years and 5 years, respectively, for the purpose of on-lending. As for the automatic route, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation raised $500 million for modernisation of project, while Reliance Utilities and Power garnered $300 million for refinancing of earlier ECB. Besides, Idea Cellular raised $155.08 million for refinancing earlier ECB, while Export-Import Bank of India borrowed $75 million for sub-lending."

For its part Pakistan often gives safe havens to agents of chaos, violence and terror“. He added: “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organizations (like) the Taliban“. He signaled a number of changes in US Afghanistan policies, warning that it was time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to “civilization, order and to peace“.It is clear that the heat is going to be turned on Pakistan by the Americans. The US Congress is proposing to enact legislation to progressively reducecut off economic and military aid and supplies to Pakistan. America's allies, notably UK, Germany, and Japan will supplement the American aid effort. The US will also be enhancing its military presence in Afghanistan. The proposed US Congressional Legislation requires the Administration to deny economic and military assistance to Pakistan, if it does not mend its ways.Trump has indicated that while it “may be possible“to have a political settlement with “elements in the Taliban“, this can take place only after it ends violence.Secretary of State Tillerson has stated: “This entire effort is intended to put pressure to have the Taliban understandthat you will not win a battlefield victory and we may not win one, but neither will you“. He added: “At some point in time we have to come to the negotiating table and find a way to bring this to an end“. Tillerson also made it clear that clear that the US could revoke the status of “Major NonNATO ally“ that Pakistan enjoys, clearing the way for stringent restrictions on arms supplies and economic assistance. It is now evident that the US intends to link arms and economic assistance, to Pakistan ending support for terrorism in Afghanistan, through the Taliban and Haqqani network. It is also possible that US drone strikes on the Pakistan based, ISI supported Taliban and its leadership will be stepped up.How will Pakistan react to these new US policies? Rawalpindi will protest loudly at US policies. The message will be quietly sent to the US that if it turns the squeeze too much, Pakistan will be forced to deny use of its soil for American military supplies and aid to Afghanistan. The aim will be to force the US to cool off on sanctions, by holding out promises of Taliban good behaviour, in the event of the US agreeing to continue economic and military assistance. This is something,which India and Afghanistan should ensure does not happen. There will substantial pressures on the US to agree to an early resumption of “unconditional dialogue“with the Taliban.This should, however remain conditional on a verifiable end to Pakistan support for cross-border terrorism.China has already made noises of support for Pakistan. Beijing has made it clear that it will back Pakistan on its position regarding a role for the Taliban, which equates the Taliban and the Afghan Government.Trump has made it clear that India remains a “strategic partner“ not just in South Asia, but across the entire “Indo-Pacific“ region. The old hyphenation between India and Pakistan has been eroded, but India has to be careful on this score. We also need to bear in mind that Russia, Iran and China have close contacts with the Taliban. Economic cooperation and militarytraining for Afghanistan has to be quickly stepped up."

"India's dedicated bankruptcy courts, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), has thrown a lifeline to individual buyers of stock and corporate securities with its latest ruling on operational costs.A Mumbai NCLT bench, which is hearing a debt-recovery petition against Yash Birla-firm Shloka Edutech, has ordered the company to pay ` . 40,000 to two applicants to cover operational costs associated with their appearance in the last two hearings. This may encourage a number of crestfallen marginal investors who had earlier avoided court cases citing high expenses. The company sold fixed deposit plans in 2012, with three year maturities. Since FY15, when the deposits matured, the company has not repaid any of its 17 depositors who are now staring at `. 15 crore losses.

In the second hearing last Tuesday, judicial member Mukul Shrawat imposed a “cost“ of ` . 10,000 for each applicant as it granted an adjournment, with the defaulting company seeking time extension. “A short adjournment is granted . 10,000 subject to cost to be paid of ` for each applicant. This is to be disbursed on and before the next hearing date,“ the judge said. The case will again be heard on Sept 14.The court rebuked the respondent company for not obeying the court's earlier order for submitting its financial statements before the court. Instead, the defendant lawyer tried to take an alibi citing Income Tax department's seizure of bank accounts. There were about five bank accounts, including those in Bank of India, Corporation Bank, Axis Bank, SBI and Catholic Syrian Bank.In Corporation Bank alone, the balance was `. 68 lakh. The respondent requested the court to issue an order to the authorities to release the money, which can be used for repayments. “Our next action will depend on the examination of submissions made during the hearing by respondent counsels,“ said Jyoti Kholia."
"INDIA'S easy win in the first one-day game will perhaps give the impression that the one-day series also will go the way of the Test series but the Indians know that it may not be the case. Sri Lanka had got off to a terrific start and were well placed at the end of 30 overs at 160 for 3 wickets. The thumb rule in One-day cricket suggests that whatever the score is at the end of the 30 overs of the team batting first they should be able to at least double that by the end of their innings provided they have wickets in hand. This is where the Indians won by taking wickets at regular intervals. This was in part due to some fine bowling by Axar Patel and some kamikaze shots by the Lankan batsmen. One of the important aspects of batting in limited overs cricket is rotation of strike and this is where India are putting pressure on Lankan batsmen. Their fielding unit in the 30 metres circle is as good as any in the world and scoring easy singles is just not possible. Having been in Lanka often in the past and now for a month, it is clear that the food here is quite delicious and while the Indian players have kept a tight control over their intake that doesn't seem to be the case with most of the Lankans some of whom are showing the effects of the food on their midriff. That does not always help quick singles and which has not helped them to rotate the strike as much. Thus they have to resort to looking for the big shots which have an element of risk attached to it. Having said that their fielding was good and some of their direct hits, one of which got rid of Rohit Sharma, were quite outstanding. Good fielding always adds a sharper edge to the bowling. What the Lankans bowlers will also be hoping for is for their batsmen to give them some runs to defend. Against this Indian batting line-up anything less than 300 is not going to be easy to defend."

"Internally displaced people who fled Raqqa sit in a truck during the fighting with Islamic State fighters in Raqqa, Syria August 14, 2017.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Amnesty International said on Thursday a U.S.-led coalition campaign to oust Islamic State from Syria's Raqqa had killed hundreds of civilians, and those remaining face greater risk as the fight intensifies in its final stages.

The rights group also said Russia-backed Syrian government forces had carried out indiscriminate attacks against civilians, reported to have included cluster and barrel bombs, in a separate campaign against the militants south of Raqqa city.

""Civilians are ... trapped in the city, under fire from all sides,"" Amnesty said in a report.

It said the U.S-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which includes Arab and Kurdish militias, must take more care as they battle for the city's central districts.

""It is imperative that all the parties to the conflict take all feasible precautions to minimise harm to civilians, including ending the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated civilian areas, in compliance with the prohibition on indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks.""

Islamic State (IS), which took over Raqqa and its environs in 2014, uses civilians inside the northern Syrian city as human shields and targets those trying to escape with snipers and mines, Amnesty said.

""IS wouldn't let us leave. We had no food, no electricity,"" a former Raqqa resident told Amnesty, one of 98 displaced individuals it spoke to in northern Syria.

COUNTING THE DEAD

It is difficult to establish how many people have died in the battle for Raqqa.

People interviewed by Reuters displaced by the fighting said air and artillery strikes have killed civilians, and Reuters reporters have seen massive material damage to buildings and infrastructure as they visit recaptured areas.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors Syria's war through a network of on-the-ground contacts, said between June 5 and Wednesday it had documented the deaths of 789 civilians, 200 of them children, in Raqqa city as a result of bombardment by the U.S.-led coalition and SDF.

Monitoring group Airwars told Reuters they believe between 725 and 993 civilians have likely been killed from coalition actions in Raqqa city since the offensive began in early June.

Hundreds more civilians have reportedly died after being fired on by Islamic State or being caught in their minefields, Airwars Director Chris Woods said.

""Coalition forces have listed 16 reports of alleged casualties in or near Raqqa between 6 and 30 June, dismissing three as 'non-credible', while 13 others are pending assessment,"" Amnesty said.

It called on the coalition to establish a more transparent and independent reporting procedure.

The coalition says it is very careful to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs against Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq, and investigates any allegations.

The coalition was unable to provide more recent statistics when contacted by Reuters.

NOWHERE TO RUN

Amnesty criticised the U.S.-led campaign for artillery and air strikes on areas containing civilians and asked for an end to attacks that risk being indiscriminate.

""Whether you live or die depends on luck because you don't know where the next shell will strike, so you don’t know where to run,"" former Raqqa resident Mohammed told Amnesty.

Syrian government forces, backed by the Russian air force and Iran-backed militias, have also been advancing against IS south of the River Euphrates that forms Raqqa city's southern edge.

Amnesty said residents had told it that air strikes had hit camps where people had fled the fighting.

Amnesty said the testimonials they collected suggested cluster bombs had been used in some of the attacks.

Russia and Syria say they only target militants.

Neither Russia, Syria nor the United States are signatories to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, but international humanitarian law prohibits indiscriminate attacks against civilians.

Amnesty urged the international community to urgently increase aid for fleeing civilians.

INTENSIFYING BATTLE

There has been a recent increase in the number of coalition air strikes on Raqqa.

Lieutenant General Steve Townsend, the coalition's commanding general, said Raqqa was now the coalition's priority following the recapture of Iraq's Mosul from IS last month.

""The fight has now entered into the very hardest parts of the city. And so our partners are needing greater assistance,"" Townsend told reporters in Baghdad on Wednesday.

Townsend said it was logical to assume there had been ""some increase"" in civilian casualties as a result of increased strikes, but that he had seen no hard evidence that casualties had increased significantly.

The United Nations says at least 200,000 people have fled Raqqa in recent months, and that up to 20,000 civilians remain trapped inside.

Islamic State is on the back foot in both Syria and Iraq. The U.S.-backed SDF have captured swathes of its territory in northern Syria and Russia-backed Syrian government forces are making rapid advances in the central desert area."

"It was a dream come true for 15-year-old Saumya Dubey who got an opportunity to don the role of Station House Officer (SHO) of the Civil Lines police station for a day. The class X student won an essay competition organised by the Allahabad Police on August 8 and subsequently won herself an opportunity to play cop for a day . Saumya beat 23 other students to win the coveted prize. A total of 25 children from different schools of Allahabad had participated in the essay writing competition on the topic ` A society without police' which was judged by Prof Jaya Kapoor of the English department of Allahabad University .Saumya's essay was judged to be the best while Parimal Agarwal and Marindra Nath bagged second and third positions, respectively . Talking to us, an excited Saumya said, “I want to be an IPS officer, and this is like half my dream fulfilled. Earlier, just the name of the police used to frighten me but now it has all changed. Especially when I got the opportunity to be a cop for a day and live the life of police constables and officials for a day. Now, I feel that police can discipline the society and help in maintaining law and order only when people cooperate with them,“ said Saumya, who loved interacting with the cops and the complainants. The youngsters also fulfilled all her duties as a police officer for a day and took stock of the rank and files of the police personnel. She also visited various places and witnessed the duty of the traffic police at the Subhash Chowk in Allahabad. As a police officer, Saumya also stressed on equality in meting out equal punishment to both boys and girls.“There should be no difference in punishment for a similar crime committed by a boy or a girl,“ she said adding, “Girls should not expect leniency when their crime is as serious as the one committed by a boy .“ A total of 25 children from different prestigious schools had participated in the easy writing competition and subsequently the copies were checked by Prof Jaya Kapoor of English department of Allahabad University. Apart from Saumya, Parimal Agarwal and Marindra Nath bagged second and third positions, respectively. Giving us more information about the competition that was organised by the Allahabad Police to sensitise the public towards the police and to create better understanding between the two, Vineet Jaiswal, ASP told us, “The students who secured the first, second and third positions, respectively, were felicitated by the district police chief with trophies and certificates at the Reserve Police Lines on August 15.Saumya Dubey, whose essay was adjudged best was given an opportunity to be the SHO at Civil Lines Police Station for a day while the other children were also given a chance to see and monitor the routine and other works of the policemen closely at the same police sta tion. We organised this activity so that the fear people, specially kids, have of the men-inkhaki is driven away . The department wants to generate confidence in people about the police and remove any misconceptions that prevail regarding our police force by letting children sit on a Station Officer's chair and be a part of the proceedings at a police station.“ During the activity , the students were also made aware of several other departments and services of the police including the 1090 Women Power Line, Dial 100 emergency services, cyber crimes, registration of FIRsNCR, online registrations of complaints, the rank structure of policemen, control room, wireless and other routine work."

"It's almost a month now to the Siddhi Sai building collapse. But almost all the homeless survivors are still staying with relatives or in rented rooms in the absence of any temporary rehab in the vicinity . State housing department officials said this is despite the fact that the department has handed over buildings around the crash site to the BMC for their rehabilitation and that BMC too owns a few flats in Ghatkopar. A senior BMC official said that though BMC had flats in a private building in Ghatkopar, they were reserved for PAPs (project-affected people) of BMC works and its staff as per rules. Moreover, it was directed by CM Devendra Fadnavis that PAPs must be given flats in SRA buildings owned by the state so the Ghatkopar flats legally cannot be allotted to the victims' families, he added. The families don't want to move from Ghatkopar and have refused to go to the SRA buildings in Bhandup and Kurla allotted to them. The reconstruction proposal is also stuck as the contractors who are ready to rebuild as well as the affected residents have refused to allow any flats for Sunil Shitap, the main accused. A local BJP corporator has reportedly offered to reconstruct the building free of cost, and the BMC is reportedly keen on the proposal. “The opposition to offer Shitap his three flats in the building is the only hurdle to the reconstruction,“ a bureaucrat said. A local BMC official said around four-five buildings in Kurla and Bhandup they had received from the housing department through the SRA have been flatly refused by the survivors, who say they want to be in Ghatkopar. Lalchand Ramchandani, one of the affected residents, said the buildings in Bhandup and Kurla are far away from the station and are not suitable for most families considering the `livelihood' nurtured over the years. However, he said he was happy that the government was moving fast with the help of a local corporator to reconstruct the building."
"J. P. YADAV New Delhi, Aug. 23: The Union cabinet today cleared a proposal to set up a commission to examine the sub- categorisation of other backward classes in a decision seen as a ploy to introduce a new brand of Mandal politics aimed at isolating the heartland's regional parties. The main targets behind the decision seem to be two Yadav leaders: RJD chief Lalu Prasad in Bihar and Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh. BJP sources said the very news of the sub- categorisation would draw the non- Yadavs or the most backwards towards the party. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who has since rejoined the BJP- led NDA, had in the past used the strategy successfully to fight "" Mandal messiah"" Lalu Prasad. More recently the BJP had played the same card in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections early this year, wooing the politically deprived backward castes by pitching them against the dominant Yadavs. The strategy is believed to have powered the party's electoral sweep in the key state that sends 80 MPs to the Lok Sabha. One of the terms of reference of the proposed commission hinted that certain castes ( read politically dominant Yadavs) had so far cornered the lion's share of the reservation cake. The commission, it said, would "" examine the extent of inequitable distribution of benefits of reservation among the castes/ communities included in the broad category of OBCs"". Sources said the Narendra Modi government planned to create two or more categories within the OBC category and allocate quotas based on how deprived the castes and communities were. "" Modi government's decision to give priority to extremely backwards castes and provide reservation benefits through sub- categorisation is a just initiative,"" BJP president Amit Shah tweeted. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also welcomed the move, saying it would expand the benefits the OBCs have reaped, indicating the political initiative behind the decision. Nine other states, including Bengal, have carried out sub- categorisation of OBCs. BJP managers said the cabinet's decision was aimed at taking Nitish's and the party's successful Uttar Pradesh strategy to the national level with an eye on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. With Nitish back in the NDA fold, they said, the party has a better chance to expand its political reach among the extremely backward castes. In his first stint as Bihar chief minister in 2005, Nitish had sub- categorised the OBCs or formed a quota within the larger OBC quota by creating two categories — backwards and extremely backwards. The idea was to make hundreds of castes from the larger OBC category break ranks with the dominant Yadavs. The move had led to Nitish carving out his own vote base known as the "" atyant pichhda "" or EBCs ( extremely backward classes) that formed over 30 per cent of Bihar's population. In UP earlier this year, the BJP had fielded over 40 per cent non- Yadav OBC candidates and run a below- the- radar campaign to highlight that only two sections, the Yadavs and the Muslims, had reaped the benefits of power under the Akhilesh Yadav government. The communal angle was also used with a view to consolidate the wider Hindu vote. The strategy worked well, BJP sources said. A similar strategy was employed to isolate Dalit leader and BSP chief Mayawati by fielding a good number of non- Jatav Dalits. The BJP has been consistently trying to play OBC politics and the recent proposal to give constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes Commission was a move in this direction. The legislation went off track after the Opposition forced a key amendment in the Rajya Sabha, where the NDA is in a minority. BJP sources said the party planned to go all out against the Congress by accusing it of being anti- OBC. Modi and Shah have directed party leaders, MPs and MLAs to raise the issue in a big way among OBCs. Earlier, the BJP had made a conscious pitch to shed the image of a "" Brahmin- bania"" party by projecting Modi, who comes from a backward caste, as its candidate for Prime Minister in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.

"JAYANTAROY CHOWDHURY New Delhi, Aug. 23: The Narendra Modi government today announced that the RBI would soon issue Rs 200 notes, the first time that such a denomination is being introduced in the country. The government, which scrapped 86 per cent of the currency in circulation last November by demonetising Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, did not say why a Rs 200 note is being launched or how many would be printed. There have been complaints of a shortage of Rs 100 notes. Bank customers have complained about the alarming increase in soiled Rs 100 notes. Some customers felt it might have been a better strategy to print more notes that people wish to use rather than foist a higher denomination on them. The Rs 200 notes may be issued next month — just ahead of the festive season. While making the announcement on the new notes, finance minister Arun Jaitley quelled fears that the government might now decide to demonetise the Rs 2,000 note. "" No, there was no such discussion,"" he told reporters. After demonetisation, there were reports that people were facing problems in using the Rs 2,000 note as there weren't enough smaller denomination notes of Rs 100 and Rs 500 to make transactions painless. "" The absence of a Rs 1,000 note and poor quality of new notes led to a crisis of change in the market,"" said Amit Banerjee, an independent merchant banker advising East Asian funds investing in India.

Jammu Kashmir High Court (Jammu Wing) today admitted three separate Habeas Corpus Petitions filed by 3 Burmese Rohingya Muslims jailed under preventive detention and directed concerned authorities to allow their relatives to meet them.



Justice Janak Raj Kotwal while hearing three separate Habeas Corpus Petitions filed by detained Rohingya Muslims, Justice Janak Raj Kotwal issued notices to the Principal Secretary Home Department J&K Government, Director General of Police J&K, ADGP (CID) J&K, Director General (Prisons), District Magistrate Jammu, Senior Superintendent of Police Jammu and Superintendent District Jail Jammu, returnable in the week commencing September, 11, 2017.

After hearing Advocate Sheikh Shakeel Ahmed with Advocates Amjad Khan and Towkeer Nazir appearing for the three petitioners namely Noor-ul-Amin son of Syed Ahmed, Shabir Ahmed son of Noor Ahmed and Mohammad Saleem son of Sikander all residents of Kargil Colony, Narwal Bala, Jammu and presently lodged at District Jail Amphalla, Jammu, Justice Janak Raj Kotwal also directed the Jail Authorities of District Jail Amphalla Jammu to allow access to the relatives of the detenues as in the petitions the petitioners specifically prayed that their blood relations are not being allowed to meet them in the Jail.

WHY TRANSLOCATION IN BUFFER ZONE

The buffer zone forms the periphery of the protected area and anthropogenic pressures are similar too.

Tigers entering the buffer zone from Corbett Tiger Reserve are most suited for translocation to the western sector of Rajaji given their ability to adapt to new areas

EFFORTS TO INCREASE TIGERS

The WII suggested relocation way back in 2010. In its study it suggested tiger translocation as means to revive tiger population in the western sector of the Rajaji National Park.

The National Tiger Conservation Authority gave its nod to go ahead with the relocation plan in June

Efforts are on to relocate tigers from the buffer zone of Corbett Tiger Reserve to the western sector of Rajaji Tiger Reserve to augment tiger population there. The success of the progamme depends on survival of tigers after they are translocated, therefore authorities concerned at the Rajaji Tiger Reserve and the WWF do not want to take any chances. The survival of tigers relocated from the buffer zone is comparatively better to those in the protective areas. Dr AK Singh, a senior WWF official and also member of the Tiger Relocation Programme, said, “The tiger population in Jim Corbett is spilling onto buffer zones that form part of various forest divisions in Terai. It is the ideal place for choosing tigers to be relocated.” He said that WWF had already assisted in training its staff at Panna Tiger Reserve of Madhya Pradesh, which witnessed a similar reintroduction programme in the past. The buffer zone forms the periphery of the protected area and anthropogenic pressures are similar too. Moreover, tigers entering the buffer zone from Corbett Tiger Reserve are most suited for translocation to the western sector of Rajaji given their ability to adapt to new areas. Efforts to reintroduce tigers in the western sector have been underway for long. The Wildife Institute of India (WII) suggested relocation way back in 2010. In its study—Population Viability of Tiger in their North Western Range Limit, Terai Arc Landscape—it suggested tiger translocation as means to revive tiger population in the western sector of the Rajaji National Park. The study suggested initiation of translocation to prevent imminent local extinction of tiger in the western sector. The National Tiger Conservation Authority finally gave its nod to go ahead with the relocation plan in June. Since then Rajaji Tiger authorities, wildlife conservationists NGO, WWF and experts from WII have been working on the project, which would be materialised after the monsoon season ends. The Corbett Tiger Reserve and eastern sector of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve have booming tiger population. But, there are just two tigresses in the western sector of Rajaji Tiger Reserve for more than a decade now."
"Judicial preference towards a liberal and expansive interpretation of fundamental rights, particularly of the Right to Privacy, would consolidate the Constitutional promise of the existence of a personal realm for all individuals; where it is impermissible for the Government to enter. In the absence of such an assurance, just as ‘awareness that the government may be watching chills associational and expressive freedoms’, the plausibility of governmental amassing and abuse of private data stifles personal liberty.While the fascicule of fundamental rights under Part III of the Constitution continue to evolve and grow, the legally permissible restrictions which could be placed on any one of them continue to remain limited and exhaustive, and rightly so. Inasmuch as the Constitution is the manifestation of the sovereignty of the people, the government may exercise its limited authority in the manner codified in the Constitution, and in no other manner at all.

Therefore, any procedure established by law which creates inroads into one’s right to privacy must be just, fair, and reasonable; as opposed to arbitrary, fanciful, or oppressive.While the jurisprudential evolution of the fundamental Right to Privacy continues on a case-by-case basis, the Parliament itself has expressly recognised the  fundamental Right to Privacy; by either reiterating the protection of the said right in statutory provisions or by introducing limited fetters, in tune with constitutionally permissible reasonable restrictions, on the exercise of the Right to Privacy.  Parliament, a constituent constitutional institution, having expressed thus, the executive government cannot prevaricate; for, the government is a creature of the same Constitution and remains answerable to Parliament.

RAKESH Bangalore, Aug. 23: Salesian clergy and colleagues of a priest kidnapped in Yemen by suspected Islamic State fighters more than a year ago are expecting he will be released as external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj has confirmed he is alive and that the government is trying to get him freed. Father Tom Uzhunnalil had appeared even more frail and sickly than earlier in his last video appeal for release, issued in May. Uzhunnalil belongs to the Salesians of Don Bosco mission, Bangalore province. "" We now feel there is hope of his release as the minister said Fr. Tom is alive and that the Prime Minister has sought the help of the Saudi king,"" said Father Jose Koyickal, the vice- provincial of the Salesians in Bangalore who was among the five priests who met Sushma in New Delhi on August 17. However, Koyickal said he was not sure whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi had raised the matter with the Saudi king, Salman bin Abdul Aziz, during his two- day visit to that country in April last year or on more recent occasions. "" The minister ( Sushma) said the government was treating the issue as a highpriority matter and was in touch with several channels to get him freed,"" said Koyickal, adding he didn't know if the government "" channels"" had managed to establish contact with the captors. Armed IS fighters allegedly kidnapped Uzhunnalil, 57, on March 4 last year from a home for the elderly in Aden where he worked. Sixteen people, including four nuns from the Missionaries of Charity, were killed in the incident."

"Karachi, Aug. 23 ( Reuters): Pakistan has rejected US criticism of its efforts to fight terrorism, saying it should not be made a scapegoat for the failure of the US military to win the war in Afghanistan. President Donald Trump unveiled his policy for Afghanistan on Monday, stepping up the military campaign against Taliban insurgents and singling out Pakistan for harbouring them. US officials later warned that aid to Pakistan might be cut and Washington might downgrade nuclear- armed Pakistan's status as a major non- Nato ally, in order to pressure it to do more to help bring about an end to America's longest- running war. Pakistan's powerful military chief, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, met US ambassador David Hale today and told him Pakistan was actively working for peace in Afghanistan. "" We have done a lot ... and shall keep on doing our best, not to appease anyone but in line with our national interest and national policy,"" Bajwa was quoted in an army press statement as telling Hale. Pakistani foreign minister Khawaja Asif added his voice to a chorus of indignation over the US criticism, reiterating Pakistan's denial that it harbours militants. "" They should not make Pakistan a scapegoat for their failures in Afghanistan,"" Asif said in an interview with Geo TV late yesterday. "" A group of influential Pakistani clerics including Samiul Haq, who runs a Islamic seminary where many senior Afghan Taliban studied, angrily condemned the US. "" America is the enemy of the Muslim ummah ( community),"" Haq told a news briefing along with other clerics who preach an extremist doctrine. "" The government of Pakistan should quit the alliance for war against so- called terrorism,"" Haq added. "" The heavens will not fall if America gets angry with us."" Pakistan has for years been battling homegrown Islamist militants who are seeking to overthrow the state with bomb attacks and assassinations. But critics say the Pakistani military nurtures other Islamist factions, including the Afghan Taliban, which are seen as useful to Pakistan's core confrontation with India. Asif said Pakistan had suffered great losses from Islamist militancy — the government estimates there have been 70,000 casualties in militant attacks, including 17,000 Pakistanis killed — since Pakistan joined the US "" war on terrorism"" after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The relationship between the two countries has endured periods of extreme strain during the past decade, especially after al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by US special forces in Pakistan in a 2011 raid. Last year, a US drone strike killed then- Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour in southwestern Pakistan, an attack Islamabad protested as a violation of its sovereignty. Pakistan has denied knowledge that either bin Laden or Mansour were in the country. Tough line Hailing Trump's new tough line against Pakistan, top US lawmakers have demanded that Islamabad be designated a "" state sponsor of terrorism"" and its major non- Nato ally status be revoked to force it stop from supporting terrorist groups. Trump yesterday called out Pakistan for supporting terror groups. The criticism came as a part of his speech outlining the new US strategy to end the 16- year war in Afghanistan."

"KARNAL: Faced with an acute shortage of cops, the Haryana police department will find it difficult to maintain the law and order situation in the wake of the upcoming verdict in the Dera Sacha Sauda chief rape trial case The department has failed to fill vacant posts despite having faced law and order problems several times in the past few years. Whenever faced with shortage of staff, the state government largely depends on paramilitary forces to maintain law and order in case of emergency as there are not enough police personnel in the districts. Sources said the state police department has a total sanctioned strength of about 62,000 personnel, including the armed police, but it has only 42,000 personnel on its roll. Figures reveal that most of the districts have only 1,100- 1,400 cops against the requirement of about 3,000. The number of policewomen in most of the districts is around 50. To maintain law and order, the government has allowed the district police to appoint home guards jawans and special police officers. Sources said Kaithal district has only 1,100 cops, 1,200 each in Kurukshetra and Yamunanagar and 1,500 in chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s segment Karnal. Even a major district like Gurgaon is facing a shortage of about 900 cops, raising questions over the safety and security of people, especially women, as women personnel comprise only 6.35% share in the state police. In Rohtak district, which was the epicentre of the Jat agitation last year in which 31 people died and public and private properties of several crores were set afire, about 1,000 posts of cops are vacant. To bridge the gap, the state government had started the recruitment of constables this year and even changed the recruitment by revising the minimum height eligibility for males in general category from 172cm to 170cm. State director general of police (DGP) BS Sandhu could not be contacted despite repeated attempts."

"Katrina Kaif, the sizzling hot Bollywood babe, who will next be seen opposite Shah Rukh Khan in the upcoming flick on Dwarf being made by Aanand L Rai, did not accept the title Katrina Meri Jaan for the film because the break up shown in it was too close to reality with Ranbir Kapoor. In fact, originally the makers wanted the title to be Katrina meri Jaan as King Khan is shown as a big fan of the actress, who was supposed to be Kat herself. Here is what an insider told a daily in this regard.

“The script was written with the idea of Katrina playing Katrina in the film and SRK being her biggest fan. Kat asked the makers to change the character’s name because she didn’t want people to think it’s completely based on her life.”

“Especially, because the character of the actress in the film goes through a terrible break-up with her actor-boyfriend. Given that Ranbir and Katrina’s break-up is still being talked about, she wasn’t comfortable with the similarities being drawn between her reel and real life. It was too close to reality, so she requested Aanand to use a different name for her character.”"

Mumbai: Amid shrill calls for double- digit growth, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) deputy governor Viral Acharya has warned that such faster GDP (gross domestic product) expansion is always debt-driven and could crash at some point with disastrous consequences.

He said instead the focus now must be to structurally set the economy on the right direction so that when it gets its mojo back, growth can pick up at a more furious pace that will be more sustainable.

“I think, invariably, the episodes of 9 to 10% growth are all laden with massive debt-based funding of some asset class,” Acharya told an Asia Society event on late Wednesday night.

Expressing his apprehensions over such a state of the economy, he said, “I get scared when an economy grows at 9 to 10% because it is not that easy to generate sustainable growth of 9 to 10%. You got to have generated tremendous improvement in your productivity in a short period to be able to deliver that kind of growth.”

But unfortunately such an economy will come crashing down and “we have already witnessed such crashes right here as well as elsewhere in the past,” he said.

With focus on inflation control and other measures to correct the balance sheets of companies and banks, “the RBI in its own way is paving the way for more sustainable growth for over next three to five year horizon down the road,” he said.

“It would be a mistake if we do not repair our balance sheets in a quick and an efficient manner now so that we can start growing fast in a sustainable way,” Acharya said.

Defending the inflation targeting, he said it is the right thing to embark on as “now there is much clearer purpose in setting up interest rates than we had in the past.”

Describing the bankruptcy code as a significant stride in starting to resolve stressed assets, he said “even though things might look a little painful in the short-run, because when you resolve assets you take haircuts on bank-balance sheets, leaving you with large losses, I think this is the pain we must accept as the imbalances have really been building up over a long period.”

Last week, RBI Governor Urjit Patel had also warned that the banks, especially the state-run banks, would have to take huge haircuts on their current exposures under any resolution plan agreed within or outside the IBC.

Acharya said it’s too much to expect that private capex will suddenly and quickly come back given the large bad assets in the system which is over Rs8 trillion now. But he expressed optimism that companies would start investing again."
"Law board faces calls to endorse SC verdict RASHEED KIDWAI Bhopal Aug. 23: Pressure is mounting on the All India Muslim Personal Law Board ( AIMPLB) to take a stringent stand against instant triple talaq amid growing articulation among Muslims that the community leaders have missed an opportunity to initiate reforms from within. The 51- member executive of the board, a private body formed to defend the Shariat personal laws and which derives its influence from the endorsement of almost all Muslim sects, will meet in Bhopal on September 10 to take a formal stand on the instant divorce in the wake of yesterday's Supreme Court ruling striking down instant triple talaq as unconstitutional. Usually, the stand taken by a private body is immaterial once the highest court of the land has outlawed practices like the instant triple talaq. But the official position of the board is expected to play a crucial role in the implementation of the court order on the ground, especially because, in public perception, the instant triple talaq is seen as part of the Muslim personal law, although the majority verdict yesterday ruled to the contrary. Any ambiguity on the part of the board could create problems when violations prompt police action and prosecution under the domestic violence act. However, if the board endorses the verdict, it will help eradicate the practice. The majority view in the board is in favour of a formal stand against divorce at one go. However, some influential members do not want a dilution. A section of law board members told this newspaper that any attempt to distance itself from the affidavit it submitted before the Supreme Court during the hearing would be seen as a sign of weakness. In the affidavit, the law board had said the court could not interfere in the personal laws governing the minority community. Their reservations stem from a fear that the abrogation of the instant triple talaq might be used as a stepping stone by the Narendra Modi government to push through a uniform civil code. Lawyers in the law board are drawing solace from the majority verdict that did not question the application of personal laws in civil matters. But the apprehension was palpable. The Jamiat Ulama- i- Hind, which has nearly 10 million members, held a meeting and issued an appeal against instant triple talaq, citing a reason. "" Muslims must, under all circumstances, avoid the practice of the instant triple talaq so that others cannot find ways to interfere in our religious matters,"" said a statement by general secretary Maulana Mahmood Madani. AIMPLB members belonging to the Bohra, Shia and other small sects want board president Maulana Rabey Nadvi to declare instant triple talaq unlawful at the Bhopal meeting. They feel such an upfront stand will "" enhance the prestige"" of the board, send a positive message to Muslim women and project the outfit as a law- abiding, gender- sensitive body. In many Muslim sects, instant triple talaq was already illegal."

"Learn to speak a few words in the local language and make sure your purchase isn’t made with endangered plants or animals. These are some of the tips from the United Nations World Tourism Organization’s new “Travel. Enjoy. Respect” handbook. It is part of a global public awareness program that comes with a manual on how to be a responsible tourist.

The launch comes amid a tourism crisis in Europe this summer, where locals across Spain and Italy have been staging anti-tourism protests in response to unsustainable visitor numbers, and incidents of tourists behaving badly in their cities. Visitors to Barcelona are being greeted with messages like “Tourists go home” and “Stop destroying our lives” pasted onto lamp posts and scribbled on walls.

In a bid to curb acts of hooliganism and restore civility in their streets, Italian cities like Rome, Turin, Florence and Milan have resorted to bans on everything from outdoor drinking after nightfall, food trucks and street hawkers to eating and drinking near historic fountains. Most recently, Florence issued a thinly veiled warning to visitors in a tourism campaign dubbed #EnjoyRespectFirenze,” reminding tourists that any display of uncivil behaviour will be met with hefty fines.

“Whenever you travel, wherever you travel, remember to respect nature, respect culture, and respect your host,” said UNWTO Secretary-General, Taleb Rifai in a statement. “You can be the change you want to see in the world.

"Let’s take a look at some of the additional features on offer.

Skoda has introduced an exciting Monte Carlo Edition of its Rapid in the country at Rs 10.75 lakh (ex-showroom). The mechanicals are kept intact but the visual appeal has been upped a notch thanks to intelligent tweaks and add-ons to the stock Rapid.

The Rapid Monte Carlo Edition is based on the regular Skoda Rapid which received a cosmetic overhaul a little less than a year ago. Based on the top-end Style variant of the regular Rapid, the Monte Carlo Edition is priced at a premium of around Rs 50,000 and gets cosmetic enhancements that make it a tempting product in a segment currently ruled by the Honda City and the Maruti Suzuki Ciaz. Let’s take a look at some of the additional features on offer:

The Skoda Rapid Monte Carlo Edition features a combination of red or white body paint along with black accents on the front grille, headlamp inserts, outside rearview mirrors (ORVMs) and the taillamp cluster. Additionally, this version also gets 16-inch alloy wheels as standard.

The Rapid Monte Carlo Edition also gets a black rear spoiler.

The Rapid Monte Carlo Edition features a sportier all-black cabin with contrast red stitching on the seats and steering wheel. The special edition variant also gets aluminium foot pedals and a flat-bottom steering wheel to give it a sportier ambiance.

Other than the above mentioned cosmetic changes, the Rapid Monte Carlo Edition is similar to the regular version. Based on the Style variant of the regular sedan, the Rapid Monte Carlo features an extensive list of equipment which includes cruise control, a 6.5-inch touchscreen Drive infotainment system with MirrorLink, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity option, automatic front wiper with rain sensor, a cooled glovebox and LED daytime running lights.

In terms of powertrain options, the Skoda Rapid Monte Carlo Edition features the same 1.6-litre MPI petrol engine which develops 110PS and 153Nm of torque and the 1.5-litre TDI diesel engine which produces 105PS pf power and 250Nm of torque. While both engines come mated to a 5-speed manual transmission, the petrol variant can be had with a 6-speed tiptronic (torque converter) transmission while the diesel variant is available with the 7-speed dual clutch (DSG) automatic. The claimed fuel efficiency figures for the petrol (manual) and diesel (manual) variants are 15.41 kmpl and 21.13 kmpl, respectively. The diesel-DSG duo delivers a claimed fuel efficiency of 21.72kmpl while the petrol-AT pair delivers 14.84kmpl.

Both variants get driver and front passenger airbags along with ABS (anti-lock braking system) as standard. Additionally, the diesel automatic variant gets electronic stability control (ESC) and hill-hold function as well.

The Skoda Rapid Monte Carlo Edition will compete with the Honda City, Maruti Suzuki Ciaz, the Volkswagen Vento and the all new Hyundai Verna. Recently, Maruti Suzuki too launched a sportier version of its sedan called the Ciaz S which too features a body kit, an all-black cabin and a rear spoiler. At a starting price of Rs 9.39 lakh, the Ciaz S too makes for a compelling choice for those looking to buy a premium sedan with an all-black cabin that stands out from the regular variants.

"Liverpool, 6-3 winners on aggregate, last played in the group stage in 2014-15 and their presence means the English Premier League will have five of the 32 teams after Manchester United qualified as Europa League winners.(Photo: AP)

Zurich: Liverpool scored three goals in 12 dramatic first-half minutes, two of them from Emre Can, on their way to a hugely entertaining 4-2 win over Hoffenheim which took them back to the Champions League group stage after a two-season absence on Wednesday.

Liverpool, 6-3 winners on aggregate, last played in the group stage in 2014-15 and their presence means the English Premier League will have five of the 32 teams after Manchester United qualified as Europa League winners.

There was a huge amount at stake in Wednesday's games as teams who take part in the group stage receive a minimum fixed payment of 12.7 million euros ($15.00 million), with bonuses of 1.5 million euros per win and 500,000 euros for a draw.

Teams also receive money from the market pool which can vary from anything between 1.4 million euros to more than 50 million depending on the size of the market in the club's respective country.

Liverpool, already leading 2-1 from the first leg, looked like scoring every time they attacked against Hoffenheim and could easily have hit double figures although their defence looked vulnerable.

Can broke through in the 10th minute when his shot was deflected off Kevin Vogt and beat Oliver Baumann inside his near post, the start of a long night for the Hoffenheim goalkeeper.

Mohamed Salah stroked in the second in the 18th minute when Georginio Wijnaldum's shot hit the post and rebounded to the Egyptian in an unmarked position, then Can, also left alone, turned in Robert Firmino's pass three minutes later.

Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann quickly made a tactical substitution, replacing Havard Nordtveit with Mark Uth, who almost immediately pulled one back with an angled shot.

The Germans began to look threatening as Serge Gnabry twice went close and Uth forced Simon Mignolet to prevent a second goal which could have changed the complexion of the game.

Firmino ended Hoffenheim's hopes in the 64th minute with an easy finish after Vogt was dispossessed by Jordan Henderson, before Sandro Wagner headed one more for Hoffenheim.

Portugal's Sporting also went on the rampage, scoring four times in the last half hour to beat former European champions Steaua Bucharest, now known as FCSB, 5-1 away after they had been held 0-0 at home in the first leg.

Seydou Doumbia gave Sporting an early lead in Bucharest but Brazilian Junior Morais quickly replied for Steaua, who then put the visitors under pressure.

The turning point came on the hour when Marcos Acuna latched onto a Bruno Fernandes through ball, goalkeeper Florin Nita was caught in no man's land and the Argentine scored coolly.

FCSB lost their composure as Gelson Martins, Bas Dost and Rodrigo Battaglia added further goals.

Qarabag became the first team from Azerbaijan to reach the group stage when they qualified on away goals after losing 2-1 away to FC Copenhagen, while APOEL Nicosia and CSKA Moscow also went through.

South African Dino Ndlovu was Qarabag's hero as he scored in the 63rd minute, his fourth goal of the competition, to cancel out Federico Santander's scrambled opener for FC Copenhagen on the stroke of halftime.

Andrija Pavlovic rekindled Copenhagen's hopes by scoring in the 66th minute but Qarabag held out for a 2-2 aggregate draw to qualify on away goals thanks to Ndlovu's effort.

Georgi Shchennikov and Alan Dzagoev gave CSKA Moscow a 2-0 win over Young Boys (3-0 on aggregate) and APOEL Nicosia's 0-0 draw at Slavia Prague was enough for them to qualify for the third time (2-0) and complete the line-up for Thursday's draw in Monaco."
"Liverpool's appearance in the Champions League will go a long way towards helping the Premier League club attract quality players, manager Juergen Klopp said.

Liverpool beat Hoffenheim 4-2 in the second leg of their Champions League playoff on Wednesday, overcoming the German side 6-3 on aggregate to seal a spot in the group stage of Europe's elite competition for the first time since 2014.

""It's a big influence on the transfer market, especially if we do it more often,"" Klopp said in his post-match conference.

""If you talk to a player, they really often (mention it)... especially players we talk to. We don't have to talk to players which are not better than our players because it's difficult to find.""

The Merseyside club's most significant signing so far this window has been Egyptian winger Mohamed Salah, who joined from Italy's AS Roma in June. Liverpool have also added defender Andrew Robertson and striker Dominic Solanke to their ranks.

Klopp believes that Champions League participation has two major benefits as elite players, who often choose clubs based on their engagement in the tournament, will now be open to a move to Liverpool and also allows the club to retain key players.

""I know a few people think differently, but we do a lot of work... if you talk to them, they say if you would play in the Champions League, it would be really interesting because the club is great, the manager is not too bad..."" Klopp added.

""If you try to extend a contract with a player, (they might say), 'Yeah, I want to play Champions League' and I always think 'It's your job to do it with us together, so don't ask that we do a job and you cannot play Champions League...'

""That's what this team did, and that's why I am so happy about it.""

Liverpool's three opponents in the group stage will be announced on Thursday.

Klopp's side now turn their attention to the Premier League, where they host Arsenal on Sunday.

May insisted the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) will end after Brexit, but there remained questions over whose laws will apply to EU citizens in the UK and for businesses that operate across borders. Critics said the ECJ may continue have jurisdiction, as indicated by the paper: “The UK will engage constructively to negotiate an approach to enforcement and dispute resolution, which meets the objectives of both the UK and the EU in underpinning the effective operation of a new, deep and special partnership.” Justice minister Dominic Raab conceded London would have to keep “half an eye” on ECJ rulings in the post-Brexit situation. But May insisted: “What we will be able to do is to make our own laws... it is British judges that will interpret those laws, and it will be the British Supreme Court that will be the ultimate arbiter of those laws.”"

"Lt Col. Prasad Purohit said his discipline as an army man helped him cope with his almost nine-year incarceration pending trial. He would exercise, read, write a diary and keep mostly to himself. “I followed a strict regimen. An hour's morning walk and then weight training for 90 minutes. I have an implant in my right knee following an accident while posted in a sensitive area,“ he told TOI.The accident was in J&K, and because of it he was allowed to stay in a medical barrack and do strength training. A lot of reading and writing kept him focused. “I had four sessions of reading. The first in the morning would be my professional reading from military press.“ The second would be lighter reading: of nature, ornithology , about jungles and wildlife. Astrophysics and books by Stephen Hawking also he enjoyed. The third session, later in the day , would include biographies of military leaders, like Cariappa or General Slim, a decorated British commander (he's reading now), and books on philosophy .“At night I would delve into P G Wodehouse and P L Deshpande,'' he said. He continued his “old habit'' of maintaining a diary . “In jail, I kept to myself.'' Sometimes, in the evenings he would do riyaaz, without the tanpura.“I have trained in classical music,“ he said. Granting of bail has taken a load off his mind, and now he wants to “lose 10kg to be able to jog more''. Purohit never had his two sons visit him in jail; he would meet them in court. “Jail is a place where not even your enemy should be. Unless guilty ,'' he said."

In Lucknow,10 patients out of 1035 and in Kanpur, 4 out of 30 patients died of swine flu. “This could be due to poor infrastructure,” said Dr PK Gupta, president, Indian Medical Association, Lucknow. He said that to deal with serious patients, expertise and support systems such as ventilator were required. Absence of any one of these could raise the mortality rate in any disease, he said. The other districts with high mortality are Hapur (5 deaths in 12 cases), Lalitpur (one death and one case), Bhadohi (one death in two cases) and Jaunpur (one death in six cases). In Lucknow, 47 fresh swine flu cases were reported, taking the total number of cases to 1078. of these, 16 were minors.

"Lucknow: The Uttar Pradesh government has transferred Additional Chief Secretary (Medical Education) Anita Bhatnagar Jain in connection with death of children at state-run BRD college in Gorakhpur, an official spokesperson said on Thursday.

A high-power committee probing the hospital tragedy, where over 50 children had died in less than a week, had submitted its report to the UP government yesterday.

""Anita Bhatnagar Jain has been transferred. She has been posted as DG (Training). Her charge has been given to Rajneesh Dube,"" he said.

Dube, Principal Secretary (Revenue), would hold the additional charge of Medical Education, the spokesperson said.

In its report submitted yesterday, the committee probing the hospital tragedy has recommended initiating criminal action against the then principal of BRD Medical College and several other doctors of the hospital.

""The committee, chaired by the chief secretary has recommended initiating criminal action against then principal of the BRD Medical College Dr Rajiv Mishra, HoD Anaesthesia Paediatric department Dr Satish, in-charge of 100-bed AES ward Dr Kafeel Khan and Pushpa Sales,"" the spokesperson had said yesterday.

The committee has also recommended action under the Prevention of Corruption Act against Dr Rajiv Mishra, Dr Poornima Shukla, staff of accounts department of the medical college and chief pharmacist Gajanan Jaiswal, he had said.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had constituted the committee under the chief secretary on August 12, a day after deaths of scores of children in the state-run hospital."
"LUCKNOW: The Yogi Adityanath government has begun cracking the whip on staffers allegedly responsible for the BRD Medical College Hospital tragedy, where over 30 children died due to purported disruption of oxygen supply in a 48-hour period between August 9 and 11. An official spokesman said criminal cases were being registered against those indicted by the probe committee, headed by chief secretary Rajive Kumar. The panel, also comprising health secretary Alok Kumar and finance secretary Mukesh Mittal, submitted its report to chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday. BRD principal secretary (medical education) Anita Bhatnagar Jain has been shifted, with additional charge of the department being handed over to principal secretary (revenue department) Rajnish Dubey. The committee has recommended that criminal cases be registered against hospital officials found guilty of negligence. Action is also likely to be taken against Pushpa Sales, the private company that discontinued oxygen supply to the Gorakhpur official over non-payment of dues amounting to around ₹67 lakh. “Criminal cases are being registered against six persons and entities, including Pushpa Sales,” said a senior officer. Sources said the committee had taken Gorakhpur district magistrate Rajeev Rautela’s report into account for filing its own. Rautela had charged former principal Rajiv Mishra and anaesthesia department head Satish Kumar with failing to ensure uninterrupted liquid oxygen supply to the hospital. Chief pharmacist Gajanan Jaiswal was also accused of not maintaining logbooks and stock books for oxygen cylinders. Among the others held responsible for the tragedy in the district magistrate’s report were three staff members of the accounts department, who had allegedly failed to process the payment of bills on time, and Dr Kafeel Khan, the official in charge of the encephalitis ward. The Rajive Kumar-led panel has also charted out an action plan to prevent the recurrence of such incidents in the future. NEW DELHI: Dr RN Singh was a 28-year-old senior resident in the department of paediatrics at Gorakhpur’s BRD Medical College when the hospital got its first case of what was later diagnosed as Japanese Encephalitis. That was in 1978. Since then, the mosquito-borne viral infection has caused annual outbreaks in the region, killing hundreds of children each year. “An 8-year-old boy was brought to the emergency early in the morning with fever that was about 104 degrees Fahrenheit, convulsions, and incoherent behaviour. He went into a coma slater and died the next day. No one knew of what,” recalls Dr Singh. “Soon, the hospital was getting around 50 cases a year.” Japanese encephalitis and the deadlier Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) became the national buzzwords after 30 children died between August 9 and 11 in BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur’s largest government hospital, amid allegations that a private company contracted to supply oxygen cylinders cut supply over a payment dispute. The first JE case was reported in the North Arcot district of Tamil Nadu in 1955 and the infection stayed confined to southern India till 1973 when it was recorded from Burdwan and Bankura districts of West Bengal. In 1978, suspected outbreaks of JE were reported from 18 states and 24 states and UTs. “Gorakhpur did not have the testing facilities needed and a diagnosis was made on the basis of cerebrospinal fluid analysis. When cases started growing, samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune, which confirmed it as encephalitis caused by Japanese B virus,” he said. NEW DELHI : Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi will launch his campaign for the upcoming Gujarat assembly elections with a workers’ meeting in Ahmedabad on September 4 and the party may soon announce its poll manifesto in the western state where the party has been out of power since 1995. The workers will apprise Gandhi of the functioning of the state leadership and also air their grievances. The Congress leader will also seek their assessment of the elections scheduled for November-December this year. The party will also soon announce its campaign and screening committees and leaders such as Arjun Modvadhia, Siddharth Patel, and Shaktisinh Gohil will be given responsibilities in these panels. Congress sources said the high command has also finalised some organisational changes in the state to accommodate disgruntled leaders. The party is also unlikely to name its chief ministerial candidate to keep the faction-ridden state unit united in the run up to the polls. Sources added the party is also mulling a broad-based coalition to take on the BJP that has been ruling the state for nearly two decades now. The hard-fought victory of Congress heavyweight Ahmed Patel in the high-octane Rajya Sabha in recent memory has breathed fresh life into the otherwise crumbling Gujarat Congress months before the state goes to polls. The win is set to raise the stakes dramatically in the December assembly elections given that BJP president Amit Shah has already set an ambitious target of 150-plus seats in the 182-member House. While some central leaders are in touch with 24-year-old Patidar leader Hardik Patel, many state leaders also want social activist and lawyer Jignesh Mevani on board. At the forefront of the Ambedkarite movement in Gujarat, Mevani, 36, has emerged as the face of Dalits who comprise 7%-8% of the state population. CHENNAI: It is full-blown war in the AIADMK with supporters of deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam who marched to the sea-side resort — The Windflower Resort and Spa — at Puducherry, burnt the effigy of Dinakaran, and tried to break police cordon on Wednesday afternoon. On a day when Congress came out in full support of Dinakaransupporting MLAs by writing another letter to the governor seeking an urgent floor test, the sacked AIADMK deputy general secretary went on a sacking spree himself, targeting leaders who he thought were commenting against Sasikala. Among those ‘sacked’ by Dinakaran from party posts included minister RB Udayakumar. MLAs holed up inside the resort are said to be given instructions to stay put till further orders from Dinakaran. More bad news greeted Dinakaran camp after the Supreme Court dismissed review petition filed by Sasikala challenging the judgment holding her guilty in disproportionate assets case. V Pugalendi, TTV supporter, said, “We were expecting a favourable judgment. But we still have the option of a curative petition which we will use.” The judgment comes as a shot in the arm for the OPS camp that had raised a banner of revolt against Sasikala. In fact, it was OPS who revolted on February 7 at the Amma Memorial on Marina Beach, that plunged Tamil Nadu into political turmoil that took over six months to settle with the merger of the two AIADMK factions on Monday. But this was not be as Dinakaran breathed fire at the very prospect of the merger as he was sidelined and efforts were being made to oust his aunt Sasikala. On Wednesday, OPS thanked chief minister E Palanisami and promised to tread the path chosen by MGR and Amma. “Now I have got this opportunity to meet you all and thank Jayalalithaa for everything she did for me. For this I am grateful to EPS for giving me this chance,” Panneerselvam said to thunderous applause at a MGR centenary celebrations function in Tiruchirapalli. “I will walk the path shown by MGR and Amma,” he said. Palanisami expressed happiness over the merger and said “seeing a unified party makes me immensely happy”. Thanking OPS in return, he said, “We are together after a gap of six months and I am happy that we will be working to translate Amma’s dreams into reality.” Almost all ministers were present on the dais as a show of unity was presented to voters at the rally. With the factions merging, its MLAs gathered courage to take on the Dinakaran faction, indicating the thinking of the government. VC Arukutty, MLA from Kavundampalayam in Coimbatore, dared the 19 MLAs. “We know how to save our government,” he said. “If you pull down Amma’s government, people will not forgive you.”"

"Mamata Banerjee's clash with the BJP will not be decorous SWAPAN DASGUPTA T here was a time when the bi- annual Mood of the Nation Poll conducted by a pollster for India Today was closely scrutinized by the pundits and the politicians for the insights it provided on the all- India picture. In recent years, thanks to the steady disappearance of sobriety from the news channels and the rising perception that opinion polls are an extension of media partisanship, their importance as a focus of discussion has waned. This disavowal is unwarranted. Although opinion polls in a non- election season may not give an exact picture of how people will vote in the event of a snap poll, they can — if accompanied by robust methodology and honest sampling — tell us more about the popular mood than anecdotal evidence. The fieldwork for the present Mood of the Nation Poll was done in late- July and before the dramatic political realignment in Bihar that led to Nitish Kumar returning to the National Democratic Alliance after a gap of nearly four years. As such, the opinion poll could conceivably have underestimated the extent of political support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This is more so because Nitish Kumar was rated as the second most popular chief minister in the country after West Bengal's Mamata Banerjee. Yet, despite this late development, the poll suggested that the NDA tally is likely to hover around the 350- seat mark and some 42 per cent of the popular vote. Like in 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party is projected to win an absolute majority on its own. Again, like in 2014, the real opposition is not likely to come from the Congress but from strong regional players such as the Trinamul Congress in West Bengal. To a very large extent, the continuing hold of the BJP- led alliance on the popular imagination owes disproportionately to the personal popularity of the prime minister. The poll suggested that some 63 per cent of the electorate have given Modi a clear thumbs- up, an approval rating that is quite enviable. The disaggregated data also suggested that decisive leadership and a strong commitment to fighting corruption were perceived as the prime minister's most positive attributes. No doubt there is an alternative narrative that suggests that Modi's undiminished popularity after three years at the helm owes less to his tangible achievements as to a combination of hype and opposition disarray. That the Congress has lost its status as India's foremost national party seems to be clear to everyone except the most die- hard supporters of the Gandhi dynasty. Jairam Ramesh's description of many Congress leaders as sultans without a sultanate may be harsh, but it does accurately describe the listlessness of an organization that seems unable to evolve viable strategies to confront either Modi's indefatigable energy and the relentless social expansion strategies of the BJP president, Amit Shah. For the moment, the main thrust of the anti- Modi forces — in effect, a combination of the Congress, regional parties and a shrinking Left — seems two- fold. The lesser of these, mainly reflecting the angst of sections that have lost their influence and powers of patronage, is to emphasize that the Modi regime is extraordinary in terms of its disruptive objectives. It has been suggested, mainly by intellectuals and a section of the media, that the Modi regime is preparing the ground for the recreation of India into a xenophobic and authoritarian republic. At a private dinner last week, a senior Congress leader was heard telling guests that if the BJP won the 2019 election, it would be the last democratic election the country would witness. The claim is undeniably an overstatement and, more than being a commentary on the state of India, is an index of the paranoia that has gripped those who are frustrated by their inability to make political headway. There was, for example, a great deal of editorial excitement over the parting remarks of the former vice- president, Hamid Ansari, relating to the anxieties of India's minorities. The anti- Modi intelligentsia, which had a special soft corner for the former vice- president courtesy the patronage extended to them by Rajya Sabha TV, were also apoplectic over Modi's piercing parliamentary repartee that cast Ansari as a Muslim. Whether the prime minister should have taken note of Ansari's last bow or ignored it in the interests of courtesy is an interesting debating point. However, it can't be denied that Modi did hone in on the essential weakness of the Opposition's concerns: the over- emphasis on the disquiet of intellectuals and Muslims. Regardless of the validity or otherwise of these concerns, the Mood of the Nation poll clearly indicates that these are not counted in any meaningful way as among Modi's vulnerabilities. Maybe they should but the fact is they don't. This may, arguably, indicate a hardening of the Indian mind but it could also be a pointer to the diminishing returns from using Muslims as a human shield for larger political battles. The other thrust of the anti- Modi forces is to stitch a grand alliance of all non- NDA parties to outflank the BJP by poll arithmetic. At one time, Nitish Kumar led this charge and now the baton has been passed to Mamata Banerjee and individuals such as Sharad Yadav who sees himself as a possible magnet. The BJP on its part is likely to counter this mahagathbandhan thrust in a number of ways. First, the NDA is likely to give Nitish Kumar greater responsibility in wooing other parties and social groups into the NDA. The orphaned All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu is the low hanging fruit as it needs the Centre's benevolence to guide the leaderless soldiers of the late ' Amma' into some political order. Ensuring that the Biju Janata Dal maintains its famed equidistance in Odisha and stays out of Opposition conclaves is another objective. Secondly, the BJP is likely to bring the political war into the home turf of the Opposition. Mamata Banerjee, for example, is jubilant that the TMC made a clean sweep of all the local bodies that ' voted' last week, including, as The Telegraph reported, winning an incredible 99 per cent vote in a ward in Haldia where the Left used to prevail. The Bengal chief minister has also instructed the BJP to quit India. Yet, despite her apparent delight that the collapse of the Left has left her with a weak challenger in the form of the local BJP, Didi's anti- BJP aggression is born of intense nervousness. I t is now clear that nearly 10 TMC MPs voted for the BJP candidate in both the presidential and vice- presidential elections. This awkward fact may have been underplayed by the Bengal media but the fear of a chunk of her party walking out, partly in protest against the positioning of her nephew, is real. The next few months could see the chief minister swing between the overkill that was witnessed during last week's local polls and curious placatory statements such as ' Amit Shah bad but Modi good.' In the past, Banerjee has been good at sending out mixed signals and tempering the BJP's local expansion. The state BJP has unendingly been hobbled by charges that its expansion programme in Bengal is tokenistic, and that it would rather have a cosy relationship with Banerjee. In 2016, the BJP was confused over whether it wanted to oppose the TMC resolutely or keep lines open to ensure West Bengal's support for the goods and services tax. That phoney war now seems over. With Banerjee choosing to become the standard bearer of the Opposition assault on Modi, it is more than likely that the BJP will retaliate by taking the war into her home turf. There is no reason to believe the clash will be decorous."

"MARK LANDLERAND MAGGIE HABERMAN Phoenix, Aug. 23: President Trump, stung by days of criticism that he sowed racial division in the US after deadly clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, accused the news media yesterday of misrepresenting what he insisted was his prompt, unequivocal condemnation of bigotry and hatred. After declaring, "" What happened in Charlottesville strikes at the core of America,"" Trump delivered a lengthy, aggrieved defence of his statements after the August 12 violence that left one woman dead and the nation reeling at the ../images of swastikas in Thomas Jefferson's hometown. Notably, he omitted blaming "" both sides"" for the violence as he had on August 15. Those remarks had prompted intense criticism, including from fellow Republican leaders, for seeming to equate the hate groups and the protesters who turned out to oppose them. Removing his earlier statements about the Charlottesville violence from his jacket pocket, Trump yesterday glibly ticked off a list of racist groups that he had been urged to explicitly denounce, and ultimately did two days after the clashes. But he said the news media quoted him selectively, accused him of responding too late and ignored his message of unity. "" I hit ' em with neo- Nazi. I hit them with everything. I got the white supremacists, the neo- Nazi. I got them all in there. Let's see. KKK, we have KKK,"" Trump said sardonically of his rebuke to Charlottesville racists, after being faulted for failing to condemn those groups in his initial response on the day of the clashes. Earlier yesterday, Trump had travelled to a sunscorched border post in Yuma, Arizona, to highlight his determination to crack down on illegal border crossings from Mexico. In Phoenix, the President threatened to shut down the federal government if his proposal to build a border wall is not funded. Trump also implied that he planned to pardon Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, who became a national symbol of the crackdown on undocumented immigrants with round-' emup searches that landed him in legal trouble. "" Was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?"" Trump asked to wild whoops and cheers. "" I won't do it tonight because I don't want to cause any controversy,"" Trump said. "" I'll make a prediction: I think he's going to be just fine."" In an angry, unbridled and unscripted performance that rivalled the most sulfurous rallies of his presidential campaign, Trump sought to deflect the anger towards him against the news media, suggesting that they, not he, were responsible for deepening divisions in the country. "" It's time to expose the crooked media deceptions,"" Trump said. He added, "" They're very dishonest people."" "" The only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself and the fake news,"" he said. Trump also derided the media for focusing on his tweets, which are his preferred form of communication. "" I don't do Twitter storms,"" said the President, who often posts a few tweets in a row on a given subject, with exclamation points. It was the latest shift in what has become a nearly daily change of roles for this President: from the statesmanlike commander- in- chief who sought harmony on Monday evening by citing the example of America's soldiers to the political warrior who, just a day later, preached unapologetic division to his supporters here, eliciting louder cheers with every epithet.

"Metro rail engineers are continuously keeping an eye on Anna Flyover, the city's oldest flyover, on Anna Salai as they bore through soil close by to build tunnels. Officials said two tunnels connecting Thousand Lights with AG-DMS across the flyover will be ready by October. Engineers have installed yellow markers at specific intervals on one side of the flyover to continuously monitor soil settlement that may be triggered due to tunnel boring. At present, two tunnels are being built on either side of the flyover at a depth of 22m. As the tunnels proceed straight from Thousand Lights towards AG-DMS, they bend near the flyover to skirt its foundation. A metro rail official said the markers were placed on locations where they could install an equipment to track soil settlement or cave-in.“Our engineers monitor soil conditions every six hours,“ the official said. “One of the two tunnels will be completed by September and the other will be ready by October.“ For the first time metro rail is boring tunnels close to a flyover. Officials said it was decided at the preliminary stage of the project that the tunnels would be built on either side of the flyover to prevent any damage to its foundation that runs up to a depth of 16m. Anna Flyover, built in 1973, stands on a foundation that is built on rocky soil.Metro rail tunnels go even further down the rocky substrate at 22m. Metro rail engineers are drilling at the rate of 8m per day as applying more pressure on the soil may damage heritage buildings on the arterial road."

They were resourceful and obliging, exactly as what I had been told to expect. To top it, EFLU has an amazing library -it's heaven for students of literature.The only disappointment, however, was the lack of sports facilities,“ says Dabwan, who is also an international footballer.

The local language is Telugu, but a majority of students were from Kerala. Then there were Delhites, Tamilians and so on.

Bulls were back in action on Wednesday as the Sensex rallied more than 300 points intraday, driven by banking & financials and index heavyweights Infosys & Reliance Industries. The rally came despite sluggish global cues.

The 30-share BSE Sensex was up 276.16 points or 0.88 percent at 31,568.01 and the 50-share NSE Nifty surged 86.95 points or 0.89 percent to 9,852.50.

The broader markets outperformed benchmarks as the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices rallied more than 1.1 percent on positive breadth. About two shares advanced for every share falling on the BSE.

Market experts feel this relief rally is unsustainable because of subdued global environment and disappointed earnings.

Geoffrey Dennis, Head, Global Emerging Market Strategy at UBS said the market is in a modest consolidation phase, but he does not expect a major correction.

Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage with buy rating and target price of Rs 114 (implying 39 percent upside) on Trident, citing an attractive utilisation play.

The brokerage house believes Trident is set to benefit from multiple factors, including industry growth and expanding share of bed linen/copier paper.

Trident is set to deliver CAGR of 9 percent in revenue and 24 percent in earnings over FY17-20, driven by revenue CAGR of 44 percent in bed linen and 12 percent in bath linen, the research house said.

According to the research firm, the recently ventured bed linen segment is expected to turn EBITDA profitable by Q3FY18 as utilisation touches 40 percent. The segment's share in overall revenue should increase from 4 percent in FY17 to 9 percent in FY20, it believes.

The company most recently ventured into bed linen, with installed capacity of 43m meters. In the first year of operations, bed linen had 29 percent utilisation, and the company expects to ramp-up operations by adding new clients. Trident has already added more than 10 clients in FY18 so far, including large replenishment clients like IKEA and Amazon.

Motilal Oswal said after significant capacity expansion in bath linen (towel) in FY15, Trident is expected to reap its benefits and witness higher utilisation (65 percent in FY20 versus 50 percent in FY17), which would not require further addition of spindles as yarn capacity would be utilized in-house.

The research house feels the rising share of copier paper should lead to paper business margin expansion of 340bp to 38 percent in FY20.

Copier paper is among the top selling brands in India and commands high margins. Copier paper contributed 45 percent of paper sales volume in FY13, which increased to 60 percent in FY17.

The brokerage house said the share of Indian companies in the global textile market is on the rise as the country is becoming highly competitive in terms of raw material cost, labour cost and level of automation, leading to improved quality.

Trident has been proactive in capitalising on this opportunity, leading to an increase in the company’s share in global towel exports to the US (from 10 percent in CY14 to 13 percent in CY16). Also, the company’s share in Indian towel exports to the US has also increased from 28 percent in CY14 to 32 percent in CY16, it added.

Trident is one of India's leading diversified group of businesses headquartered in Ludhiana, Punjab. The company is one of the world's largest manufacturers of integrated home textile (bed and bath linen) and the largest manufacturer of wheat straw-based paper.

In FY17, the home textile business contributed 82 percent of its overall revenue, while Paper accounted for 18 percent. It has manufacturing plants at Budni (MP) and Barnala (Punjab) with combined installed capacity of 115mn kg of yarn, 175k MT of paper, 90MT of bath linen and 43m mtrs of bed linen. Trident also owns the world's largest compact yarn spinning unit under single roof.

At 11:01 hours IST, the stock price was quoting at Rs 87.25, up Rs 0.65, or 0.75 percent on the BSE."

Asserting that domestic manufacturing has not lost its mojo, business leader Anand Mahindra has said “a new round of boom is upon us,” and sought increased public policy focus on small businesses so that they drive this next wave of growth.

“The focus should not be on big businesses or large industry or groups. The real growth in employment and in manufacturing is going to come from SMEs, the entrepreneurial small sector,” Mahindra said at a book launch event on Wednesday.

The country has for long “disincentivised” SMEs from growth and scale through archaic labour laws that offer zero flexibility once they expand, he said.

“We have built in an incentive to stay microscopic and not to grow,” the Mahindra group chairman said, adding that fiscal and labour law—related disincentives have to be done away with and SMEs must be helped with aspects like skilling.

“Nurturing the SME ecosystem is what needs to be looked at rather than lamenting that the top—20 business houses have not invested. They are not the ones who are going to deliver employment going forward,” he said.

Mahindra also sought to downplay concerns on the manufacturing scenario, saying it is only the leveraged firms that are going slow, but there is increased interest from overseas to set shop here.

It can be noted that despite an over one decade push to increase the share of manufacturing in GDP to 25 per cent from the present 16 to 17 per cent, nothing has moved on the ground level so far.

Mahindra said that the domestic firms went on an overdrive ahead of the financial crisis in 2008 and have been in a state of fatigue ever since.

“The fatigue is still being dealt with by the banking system with the large players but that doesn’t mean our manufacturing has lost its mojo, though currently it is coming through overseas investment only,” he said.

There will be another boom in the next few years in the manufacturing sector, he said

“If consumption picks up on a very good monsoon, you are going to see the animal spirits return and you will see the fatigue in some of our industries go away,” he said.

“Do I see a boom? Yes, I see one coming in but I don’t know whether it will sustain at 9 or 10 per cent, but it has a better chance,” he added."

Thomas Babington Macaulay has long been a favourite whipping boy for both the Right and Left in India. To many he is associated with the Western idiom, the reason why an English-educated elite ruled the country for more than a century. Of course several members of this elite later turned on their masters and joined, if not led, the movement for national sovereignty, or independence from colonial rule. Nevertheless, ‘Macaulayism’ is the term given to the deliberate policy of an imperial power to redirect a subject people’s education in an attempt to influence their thought and self-understanding.

The signal moment that is cited is Macaulay’s Minute on Education in 1835, a tract in which he set out to explain his proposal for promoting English education in India at the expense of Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit, which were being taught in colonial schools.

I contend, nonetheless, that the Macaulay Minute is both overrated and somewhat misjudged in Indian cultural studies. It is true that it came from a man who was directly charged with the formation of a loyal local herd that would be indebted in serving the colonial administration. He was, after all, a bureaucrat of high standing, obliging the Supreme Council of India for five years.

But Macaulay also fancied himself as a politically liberal and cosmopolitan intellectual. One needs to ask what such a claim (of intellectual integrity in particular) might imply, coming as it does from a long tradition going back to the pre-Socratics and the Vedanta.

For most, intellectual activity would simply be the task of asking philosophically rigorous questions about objects in the world and our relationships with them. It also places emphasis on the how, by asking what are the correct ways for people, governments and organisations to act in any given situation. Intellectual honesty demands that we engage with others’ ideas as well with sincerity.

Of course, intellectuals are often not themselves honest in their words and actions; this could stem from ignorance as well as ideology. In our time, neoliberalism has proven to be an ideology that generated enormous harm to hundreds of millions. Yet many intellectuals have defended neoliberalism’s rules of the ‘free market’, notwithstanding the destruction it continues to engender.

A moral right

For Macaulay, the belief that colonialism was a moral right of the British Empire constituted such an ideology. That is why his wide-ranging essay is well worth reading in full. Unfortunately, even scholars tend to focus on select passages pertaining mainly to his suggested deployment of English-educated natives for the Empire’s strategic purposes.

Indians, and perhaps Arabs too, are rightly indignant when Macaulay claims that in his conversations with learned men in India, no one would deny that “a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia”. Still, I believe it is important to try to unravel the logic of the minute from other perspectives as well, without thereby excusing its egregious power claims and the cunning of British imperial politics.

Take, for instance, an extended comparison Macaulay makes with the case of Russia. Russia, in Macaulay’s time, has “a large educated class, abounding with persons fit to serve the state in the highest functions, and in no wise inferior to the most accomplished men who adorn the best circles of Paris and London. There is reason to hope that this vast empire, which in the time of our grandfathers was probably behind the Punjab, may, in the time of our grandchildren, be pressing close on France and Britain in the career of improvement. And how was this change effected? Not by flattering national prejudices: not by feeding the mind of the young Muscovite with the old women’s stories which his rude fathers had believed: not by filling his head with lying legends about St. Nicholas: not by encouraging him to study the great question, whether the world was or was not created on the 13th of September: not by calling him “a learned native,” when he has mastered all these points of knowledge: but by teaching him those foreign languages in which the greatest mass of information had been laid up, and thus putting all that information within his reach. The languages of Western Europe civilized Russia. I cannot doubt that they will do for the Hindoo what they have done for the Tartar.”

A cosmopolitan outlook

Macaulay here is speaking of a nation’s progress towards a more cosmopolitan outlook, but he is not thereby denigrating its own native cultures and practices. For instance, he speaks very highly of 19th century England and English literature and poetry of course, but also makes the claim that had the English literati not familiarised themselves with ancient Greek and Roman writings, they would never have produced a Shakespeare. “What the Greek and Latin were to the contemporaries of [16th century writers Thomas] More and [Roger] Ascham, our tongue is to the people of India.”

India today sits on the edge of greatness in its political and social influence in the world. The latter especially stems from its rich heritage of multicultural democratic polities and the novel ethics of ahimsa, the Dhammapada, and the grand philosophy of existence expressed in the Gita, not to mention numerous other traditions that are becoming resurgent.

But this growing presence surely also signals our inter-connectedness in a much larger planetary context, with numerous global ecological limits emerging in addition to geopolitical challenges, as well as other multicultural examples to learn from.

Indeed, it would be hard to imagine anyone asserting that a cosmopolitan education is less important or valuable today than it was two centuries ago. By default, that language and idiom are now English (it could well be Chinese in a few decades, but that is not so evident).

Similarly, like Macaulay himself, none would deny the value of alternative modes of education (from activity-based learning to gurukul structures) that dot the Indian landscape. These cannot be divided into Macaulite and non-Macaulite forms. I value my ‘Macaulite’ education greatly, at least as much or even more than my training in Carnatic classical music, but they are also mingled with the types of lessons my mother and father taught me from Indian epics, and so on.

Indeed, I would not be able to engage in this discussion here or with a wider group of colleagues from South Africa and Brazil to Indonesia, if I were not fluent in English. But engagement across cultures matters to me and, I suppose, to billions more across the world.

Moreover, given the vast disparities of caste, class and other markers of social status, excellence in education even in pre-colonial India was restricted to the elites, with a few Ekalavyas barely managing to get access to the gurukuls and other traditional schools. A Right to Education never existed prior to Macaulay and it would be disingenuous to claim otherwise.

What then are our pedagogical options? I believe it behoves us to find new hybrid forms that draw on a multiplicity of folk traditions but continue to place central emphasis on common curricula with universal access to English across the country. Otherwise, we will simply perpetuate our many ills and continue to blame Macaulay for them.

"MUMBAI : A seven-monthold leopard cub, trapped inside a 60-foot-deep well at Ottur in Pune district, was rescued following a sevenhour-long operation on Tuesday. Farmers patrolling their sugarcane field in Kolwadi found the cub clinging on to a pump at the bottom of the well around 5pm. “We heard loud cries and rushed to see what was in the well. It was a leopard cub. The only thing that prevented the animal from drowning was the pump. We immediately informed the forest department,” said Satish Bhoir, a farmer from the area. Upon receiving information, a five-member team from Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre (MLRC) in Junnar, rushed to the spot. Veterinarians from MLRC said about 2,000 people had gathered at the spot, which made the rescue difficult. “Since the cub was in distress, we deployed a specially designed trap cage to rescue it. We generally use crates for cub rescues,” said Dr Ajay Deshmukh, senior veterinarian, MLRC, in-charge of the operation. “After the forest department was able to control the crowd, we managed to completed the rescue.” Deshmukh who examined the cub said it was fit to be released back in to the wild. Forest officials said the cub’s mother was spotted in the vicinity. “An hour after the rescue, we decided to release the cub. We have told farmers to inform us about the reunion, if the witness it,” said Sachin Ragatwan, range forest officer, Ottur. Experts said there was a need to educate local residents about the significance of the species. “As human habitat expand in to the wild, leopards will be forced out of their territory and will fall in to these dangerous wells. We need a more sustainable solution,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, chairman, Wildlife SOS."
"MUMBAI: A playground in Sahar’s Sutar Pakhadi gaothan has turned into a walled airport land closed to local residents, despite being reserved for public usage. Residents said the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has turned a deaf ear to several complaints by locals and activists. Villagers said the space was used for years by the area’s football clubs and those hosting recreational activities. However, five years ago, the 3,300-sq-m open space was acquired by the Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL). A wall was put up, blocking a village road that runs through the open space. “The land belonged to my family since the 1800s. Airport representatives said the land belongs to them and they have compensated our ancestors for it. But, there is no proof of this,” said Noel Boothello, a member of one of the gaothan’s oldest families. Resident Austin Boothello said he has ownership documents that prove the land belongs to his late grandmother Rita. “After numerous complaints, we also filed a petition in the court in May. But, the BMC has failed to act,” he said. He added that the MIAL also chopped trees on the land. NGO Watchdog Foundation said the land was reserved for a playground in the Development Plan 1991 and once again in the 2016 draft. “The airport legally owns the land now, but since it has been reserved for a playground, it should be opened to public during restricted hours, according to the rules,” Sushma Rai, corporator, told HT. MIAL built the high wall around the vacant plot and built an alternative road through the village in April. When the villagers objected to the land acquisition, several policemen were brought in to control the situation. Fearing that the space in front of their houses would also be taken over, locals had put up a tin wall between the road and their homes. The MIAL spokesperson and local ward officer were unavailable for comment. “They can keep the plot and use it for the city’s development, but only if they show us the acquisition papers first. They are unwilling to meet us and show us proof,” added the Boothellos."

"Mumbai: Bollywood superstar Hrithik Roshan, who is in talks for the biopic on Patna-based mathematician Anand Kumar, believes cinema is the best medium to celebrate stories of real heroes.

Kumar runs the famous ‘Super 30’ program for IIT aspirants in Patna. He mainly trains the economically backward students for IIT-JEE. He started the program in 2002.

“If an opportunity presents itself (to narrate such stories) then it’s great. I think cinema is a fantastic medium to bring out stories that are inspiring and empowering. I am still in discussions for the film on him (Kumar). It’s not official but as soon as it will be, I will let you know,” Hrithik said in an interview.

The film tentatively titled “Super 30” will trace Anand’s rise to fame as the founder of the program. Recently Kumar posted picture of his meeting with Hrithik Roshan and director Vikas Bahl.

Though the 43-year-old superstar refrains from talking about the project, when asked if the prep work has already started for the movie, he said, “I have not signed the film. I will only be able to talk about it once it’s all official.”

If all goes well, then in his journey of 17 years in the film industry, it is for the first time that Hrithik will be acting in a biopic.

Kumar also met actress Katrina Kaif recently and this has led to speculation that she might team up with Hrithik again, after “Bang Bang”.

On working with Katrina again, Hrithik said, “I have no idea (about her being part of the film).”

"MUMBAI: The phase of consolidation and monetisation of assets is over in the Essar group, says CEO Prashant Ruia after seeing through the $12.9-billion sale of Essar Oil to a Rosneft PJSC-led consortium. The group is preparing a resolution plan for Essar Steel which is under an interim resolution professional and Ruia hopes to retain control. Edited excerpts from an interview: Do you have plans to re­enter the refining space? We have not exited the oil and gas business. We still have coal-based methane. We still have Essar Oil UK refinery. We don’t have any plans to re-enter the refining and distribution business. Are there any tax implications for this deal? Tax implications are based on the laws of the land. Part of it (the deal) will be in India and part will be in Mauritius. Based on the laws, whatever tax is applicable will have to be met. It’s too early to determine. There’s confusion regarding the non­compete agreement. Is it for three years or forever? We have already issued a clarification that it is for three years. You have reduced ₹70,000 crore worth of debt at the group level. How much would the outstanding consolidated debt be? We have said ₹70,000 crore is more than 50%, the balance will be less. The key part that has been missed is Essar’s strength to create world-class assets, starting from scratch in core sectors. We did that in telecom. We made certain investments over a period of 10 years and then we exited after selling to Vodafone. We made 10X return on our investment. We did that with Aegis. We decided to exit, and we got 5X returns. Now we have done it in oil. When we did the IPO in 1995, our market cap at that time was ₹2,000 crore. Now we have exited. The final number is ₹50,400 crore. But weren’t these exits under duress? There is no duress. The company has performed exceptionally for the past 15 years. When you exited telecom, you had reinvested in some of the other businesses... That is what we are saying here also. Now, with a de-leveraged balance sheet, we have the ability to grow the rest of the portfolio. This is the flexibility we now have. What are you going to focus on? We have got oil and gas, steel, ports, power. The ability to grow in power is limited because of the surplus in the market. We are looking at the whole set. We had to consolidate, monetise and complete the capital investment programme of ₹1.2 lakh crore, that phase is over. Now we are looking at the next phase. What is happening at Essar Steel? We are in the IBC (insolvency and bankruptcy code) process. We will respect the process. We will provide a resolution plan as we had provided earlier, which we gave to Indian lenders. We hope it will be successful. We hope we can restructure the business. Will you provide the same resolution plan or a different one? It’s too early to say. Now that the deal is done, does it give you greater flexibility? I have the flexibility now to invest and provide a plan."
"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena filed a complaint with the state election commission against a Jain leader who urged the community to vote for the BJP in the Mira-Bhayander elections to create a “meat-free society”. Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut, MP from the Rajya Sabha, equated the Jain monk, Naypadmasagarji Maharaj, to televangelist Zakir Naik, calling “poison for society at large”.

"MUMBAI: Two agencies investigated the case at different times. Two separate charge sheets were filed, with one debunking the other. Four laptops were seized and three videos and 37 audiotapes retrieved. But it’s still unclear who planned and executed the 2008 Malegaon blasts. The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) filed a charge sheet in 2009 invoking the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against the accused, including Pragya Thakur and Lt Colonel Shrikant Prasad Purohit. The probe was transferred to the NIA in 2011, which re-recorded the statements of witnesses who claimed they had made them under duress before ATS in 2008. The NIA submitted its own charge sheet to the special court in May 2016. It discharged Pragya Thakur and five others, and revoked MCOCA. But the NIA stated there was substantial evidence against Purohit and others. The ATS was silent before Bombay HC when the NIA accused it of having manipulated witnesses. When the court asked ATS to clarify its stand on Thakur’s application for bail, the ATS said the “probe had been taken over by NIA and it was for it to oppose or not oppose her plea now”. The ATS was evasive when the Bombay HC, during the hearing of Thakur’s bail application, asked about CDs, DVDs and transcripts of phone conversations that took place between accused and were a part of its charge sheet. The ATS officials said they could not remember all the details of transcripts or video clips submitted seven years ago. In its charge sheet in 2009, the ATS said the tapes revealed that an accused Sudhakar Dwivedi recorded on his laptop proceedings of several meetings. While Upadhyay, Purohit, Dwivedi and others were present at a meeting in Faridabad in January 2008, it was at a meeting in Bhopal in April that year that Thakur’s name first came up. The ATS claimed the accused decided upon Malegaon and that 1994: Lt.

The NIA suspects that the report was generated to cover tracks November 5: Purohit formally arrested in the case but the military officer claims that he was abducted on October 29 and illegally held by ATS. He Thakur was present in this meeting and had volunteered to “provide men”. “She had said while Purohit would provide explosives, she would provide them with men,” the charge sheet claimed. In June 2008, in Indore, Thakur introduced Ramchandra Kalasangra and Sandip Dange to others. These two are alleged to be the planters but have ‘remained at large’.

NEW DELHI: A day after the Rajasthan government recommended a CBI probe into 18 cases of land deals in Bikaner, Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law and businessman Robert Vadra took to Facebook to lash out at the authorities’ malice against him. “Another attempt of malicious persecution, exposed,” Vadra said, as he narrates the earlier attempts to nail him but went unsuccessful. “First, Rajasthan police filed an FIR on 26 August 2014. In three years, they filed the charge sheets, summoned documents, as also company officials, yet found not an iota of evidence,” Vadra posted on Facebook on Wednesday in response to the news of probe related to his hospitality firm. “Neither the FIR nor the chargesheets accuse the companies associated with me in any manner whatsoever...Having failed with the police FIR and chargesheets, they unleashed the Enforcement Directorate to harass and hound. Enforcement Directorate has conducted raids, seized documents and harassed in every possible manner. As they fail, they make one more sinister attempt to rope in the CBI. Has the Rajasthan government lost faith in its own police and investigation?!” Vadra said. His latest reaction comes after the new round of probe even after the Rajasthan Police last year cleared Vadra of any wrongdoing, saying he was a bona fide purchaser who was “cheated” and “certainly a victim of fraud”. “Please hound, persecute and harass as much as you want, such lies will never undermine the truth,” he wrote. The state decided to send the cases to the Central Bureau of Investigation on August 17. “We decided to refer the 18 FIRs, four related to Vadra’s company, to the CBI because these pieces of land were allotted on fake documents and sold multiple times. The central agency will unravel the conspiracy,” Rajasthan home minister Gulab Chand Kataria said. The Congress termed “pure political vendetta” the CBI questioning its leader P Chidambaram’s son Karti in a graft case and the move for a CBI probe into a “land scam” allegedly involving a company of Robert Vadra, the son-in-law of party chief Sonia Gandhi. “This is nothing except political vendetta of the worst kind which is playing itself out and it has sunk to a new low,” Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari told reporters."
"Mumbai: With lenders' bets on project loans turning awry, ICICI Bank's Chanda Kochhar has said project financing is set to undergo fundamental changes wherein greater focus will be on planning and diligence.

""To bring back investments, the fundamentals of project financing will have to change. Projects will have to be much more completely tied-up before they get funded,"" Kochhar said at the launch of a book, edited by former RBI deputy governor Rakesh Mohan, here last evening.

The ICICI Bank's managing director and chief executive said this shall include backward and forward linkages, land availability, natural resources and financial closures. She, however, was quick to add that project finance will continue to be done by banks.

The comments come amid heavy setbacks faced by lenders on project loans given out over the last few years across all sectors. The setbacks, coupled with external factors which have slowed down demand, have resulted in lenders shifting focus on retail for growth opportunities.

Within corporates, banks have been generally doing a lot of short-term working capital loans and also minimising risks by restricting credit supply to better-rated corporates. Kochhar said not just banks, even promoters will not be committing money before all the tie-ups are in place.

""A lot more time will be spent on planning before monies get committed. That will be a substantive change in project financing,"" she said.

Kochhar also diagnosed the problems faced by lenders during the post-2008 credit boom that resulted in the reverses, saying a lot of assumptions did not come true. These included growth rates halving to about 5 per cent, delays in project clearances, dip in commodity prices and delays in backward and forward linkages, she said.

""The cash flows fell short but the leverages became a certainty because projects had started and debt taken,"" she said.

There is also a need for long term money from pension funds, infra development funds and insurers to enter the project finance space in such a way that they take over the banks' exposure after the implementation risks recede, she said.

This will help free up the money for banks to support the next wave of credit growth, Kochhar said. It can be noted that for the past two-three years, credit growth has been continuously slipping with the past fiscal being the worst when it fell to historic laws.

In FY17 bank credit slipped to a pale 5.08 per cent, the lowest since fiscal 1953 when it was a paler 1.8 per cent. Even in the first quarter of this fiscal credit demand remained anaemic at under 6 per cent."
"Nanasaheb Shendkar had a thriving business of thermocol decorative items that he made in his own factory . For 25 years, thermocol makhars (decorative arches) made in his factory graced many Ganesh festivities. However, 63-year-old Shendkar could not turn a blind eye to the toll his business was taking on the environment. So, unmindful of the adverse effect on his own business, Shendkar decided to shut down his thermocol moulding factory . “My factory was in a farm. I operated there for 25 years, employing 200 people. However, after the first 15 years, I began to see that burning of the leftover thermocol was causing a lot of air pollution and immense damage to the ecosystem,“ said Shendkar whose factory was based in Loni, a place near Pune. He was also disturbed by the water pollution caused by thermocol decorative items used during Ganeshotsav . In fact, he also held himself accountable for all the makhars that were disposed in wells, ponds and rivers after the festival. “There is equipment worth lakhs of rupees that is lying idle in the factory that I closed down, but my conscience does not allow me to sell it. The thought that someone else will continue what I stopped still bothers me,“ added the Mumbai resident. Shendkar closed down the factory 17-years ago and started making foldable makhars that can be reused for several years. However, he claims that many traders are cashing in on the high demand for these makhars and charging exorbitant amount from the customers, which is acting as a deterrent to adoption of eco-friendly makhars. Voicing his disappointment, Shendkar said, “My family and 100 labourers work on these makhars. Our main motto is not to make profit from these, but to create awareness about eco-friendly celebrations. However, if they charge so high, then it will discourage people from buying them and the whole purpose of the initiative is lost.“ He further added that these paper makhars are available for as less as Rs200. The price depends on the size. His makhars, which mainly have a traditional look, are popular worldwide. He exports around 1,000 of these to Japan, Dubai, Australia, the US and the UK. They are available in various sizes and are also available in 3D format. Shendkar is displaying his decorative items at the Jawaharlal Nehru Gallery on Ghole Road till August 25."

"Nandan Nilekani, the architect of Aadhaar, is set to return to Infosys, the company he co-founded 36 years ago at the age of 26, as non-executive chairman in the next few days. He will come for a predetermined period with the aim of achieving a bunch of predetermined goals, mainly identifying the next CEO and giving him enough air cover to find his bearing in the top job. Restoring investor, customer and employee confidence in the company will be another priority . Nilekani, who until the weekend was very sure that he would not take a formal position in Infosys -he quit in 2009 to join the Manmohan Singh government as chairman of UIDAI -was persuaded to rethink by well-wishers, big investors and crucially some members of the board. Infosys co-chairman Ravi Venkatesan and independent directors Kiran Mazumdar Shaw and D N Prahlad visited him on Monday at his Koramangala residence and spent hours brainstorming with him on the best outcome for the company ­ his return, even on a temporary basis to Infosys. Sources say things are still fluid at the moment with Nilekani yet to sign off formally on his comeback be cause a number of things ­ including a buy-in by founder N R Narayana Murthy into this plan ­ have to fall in place before a formal announcement. Said a source, “The math has to work out for Nilekani to return. It's almost certain that he will come back as a non-executive chairman, but it's not a done deal yet.“ On a hectic Wednesday , things started moving quickly once it became public that Murthy had cancelled an investor call scheduled for the evening. Though the reason given was ill health, it's believed it was also to allow all the different pieces that are in motion now to play out. Twelve domestic mutual funds and insurance companies told the Infosys board on Wednesday morning that they want Nilekani to return in a “suitable capacity“.Talks are ongoing with a few of the large, international investors. Nilekani's arrival will also mean that the board will have to be reconstituted. According to sources three to four directors are set to resign: chairman R Seshasayee, directors Roopa Kudva and Jeff Lehman. Possibly even co-chairman RaviVenkatesan. The directors who seem safe are D N Prahalad, who is a distant relative of Narayana Murthy's and joined the board in October 2016; D Sundaram, the latest to join the Infosys board (June 2017), and Punitha Kumar Sinha.Though Biocon chairman Kiran Mazumdar Shaw is a close friend of both Murthy's and Nilekani's, it isn't clear whether she will stay or go. Unless a director resigns, a board member can be removed only through an extraordinary general meeting at which the resolution has to be passed by a majority of the shareholders. It's believed nobody wants to go down that path with resignations on the cards. It will be interesting to see if the company's former CEO Vishal Sikka, who on Friday last said he would stay till March 31, 2018 as executive vice-chairman, will quit with immediate effect or stay . He will probably opt to go. It appears that on Wednesday Nilekani and Murthy were locked in talks, with sources saying that Nilekani wanted some assurances before committing to return to Infosys. It's speculated that as Nilekani is returning only for a `predetermined' period, it would be advisable to have a founder on the board. It will be interesting to see if Murthy agrees to join the board under Nilekani's chairmanship. Nilekani, who has cancelled a long-planned twomonth visit to the US, is the third largest founder shareholder of Infosys with a 2.3% stake."

"Nandurbar trafficking case

Six months after 16 minors, rescued from brothels in Nandurbar, were handed over to their so-called parents by a local magistrate, cops managed to trace nine of them. A team from Rajasthan police made a grand entry into the Aurangabad bench of Bombay High Court (HC) on Tuesday with the minors and people claiming to be their parents.It took a special team of cops from the Rajasthan anti-trafficking cell weeks to trace and eventually cajole the girls appear at the high court, which had in June this year ordered that all the 16 minors should be traced and produced before them.The court had asked cops to trace them urgently as it was feared that the so-called parents to whom they were handed over might force them back into prostitution.“After the bench passed an order to find them and produce them before court, I immediately got in touch with senior cops in Rajasthan, who in turn patched me through to the anti-trafficking cell. A lady officer on the team was put on the job. She has worked really hard to trace these girls,” said Amarjeetsingh Girase, chief government pleader at HC. The lady officer has been working extensively with villagers who allegedly push young girls from their families into sex trade.“With the details of the girls we had provided, she was able to trace the girls. But she did not want to nab and force them to come to the HC. So she developed a rapport with them over days and convinced them to come to court,” said Girase.The officer went to villages in Tonk and Bindu districts and convinced the girls and their parents to appear in court. From one such village they even won the confidence of the local sarpanch to ensure that the victims are produced before HC.The girls and their parents appeared before the division bench of Justice SS Shinde and Justice AM Dhavale, who heard the parents and counsels from all sides in-camera. The hearing went on till Wednesday evening. The court is yet to pass final orders.The girls were among 68 people rescued from a red light area Shahada, in Nandurbar district, on January 10 this year. The operation was led by Pune-based Rescue Foundation, an NGO that works extensively in the area of anti-trafficking. This included several minors, with the youngest one being just eight years old. What was meant to be an operation to give the girls a fresh lease of life, turned out to be somewhat of a disaster. Incidentally, the bungle happened immediately after the raid, which was reported by Pune Mirror in an earlier story. Shahada cops showed only seven girls as victims of trafficking and booked the remaining 61 for causing nuisance in a public place under sections 110 and 117 of the Bombay Police Act. Typically, in such cases all girls are shown as victims of flesh trade under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act.Once the girls were produced in Shahada court, judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) Anirudh Paathak first heard the case of the seven girls who were shown as victims of trafficking and sent them to rehabilitation homes. He then turned to the case of 61girls — the accused. The JMFC initially found them guilty of causing nuisance in public place and fined them each Rs 1,200. However, within minutes of doing so, he passed yet another order, pronouncing these girls as victims of trafficking as well and sent them to rehabilitation homes.Days later, people claiming to be parents of some of the girls came forward and sought custody of their children. They argued that since the girls cannot be detained as they were shown as only causing nuisance by the cops. Following this, in February JMFC Paathak ordered the release of several girls.Of the 68 girls, 18 were found to be minors. After the release order, 16 were set free. Out of 48 adults, nine were released, 11ran away from a Nandurbar shelter, and 30 are still with homes in Pune, Boisar and Mumbai. Immediately after they were released, Rescue Foundation filed writ petitions in HC. They sought that girls be traced back and all the orders passed by lower court be set aside.The HC, on June 27 came down heavily against the cops as well as lower court. It was found during the hearing that of the 68 victims, eight were from Nepal, six were from West Bengal, two from Odisha and five from Maharashtra, while the remaining 47 from Rajasthan. “Neither the police nor the learned judge realised this significant fact indicating interstate sex traffic racket. No information, too, was given to the anti-trafficking cell and there was no supervision from the raid and investigation,” observed the HC division bench.The court expressed its displeasure over how the magistrate handed over the victims to people claiming to be their parents without verifying their credentials. They cited Supreme Court orders, which have made it clear that victims of flesh trade need to be rehabilitated, which was not done by both police as well as magistrate.“Prima facie, we are of the opinion that the proceedings conducted by the Magistrate are in breach of the provisions of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 and Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. Section 17 of the PITA mandates that while issuing orders, the Magistrate shall ensure that no person shall be restored to or placed in custody of a person who may exercise harmful influence on him,” stated the division bench. The HC had back then ordered to trace the 16 minors who had been released."
"Nepal Primer Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba’s five-day official trip to India assumes significance amid the Doklam impasse between India and China, which neighbour the landlocked country. This presents a golden opportunity for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to boost the bilateral ties and deepen the economic cooperation.

Hence, a momentous task is awaiting the NDA to maintain the momentum of India-Nepal relations in a friendly spirit. Akash Kumar, Jagraon"
"Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba arrived in New Delhi on Wednesday on a five-day visit that will see India and Nepal discuss a number of infrastructure ventures and launch two electricity transmission lines to meet energy deficient Nepal’s needs. One of the infrastructure projects expected to be finalized is a new bridge over the Mechi river on the India-Nepal border at a cost of Rs158 crore—funded by India through an Asian Development Bank loan. The Union cabinet on Wednesday cleared a preliminary pact “for laying down the implementation arrangement on cost sharing, schedules and safeguard issues for starting construction,” a government statement said.

"NEW DELHI : In a day of dramatic developments, Rajiv Bansal has replaced Ashwani Lohani as the chairman and managing director (CMD) of Air India after the latter was appointed chairman of the Railway Board. His tenure for three months is likely to be extended. Bansal, a 1988-batch IAS officer of Nagaland cadre, is currently additional secretary and financial advisor in the ministry of petroleum and natural gas. His new job as the Air India chairman and managing director is an additional charge. Bansal has served at various positions including stints at ministry of heavy industries, and ministry of electronics and information technology, but it is his stint as director in the ministry of civil aviation that will come as most handy. For Air India, the issue of disinvesting government’s stake to bring in a strategic investor is the top priority. With a debt of ₹50,000 crore, Air India has been in the red for years. “The CMD’s position is of paramount importance as he has to manage the daily operations of an airline that has been hand-tomouth for years,” said a government official, requesting anonymity. It was only recently that Air India failed timely disbursement of July salaries. Air India, which is part of the 28-member international airlines group, Star Alliance, has 35 destinations in its overseas network across the US, Europe, Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Gulf. The national carrier also has plans to add at least 7 more international destinations this year, including Copenhagen, Tel Aviv and Nairobi. Lohani often referred to himself, leaves Air India with slightly better financials since he took the corner office in 2015. In 2016-17, Lohani managed to steer the airline towards a 10% increase in revenue and a 5% trimming of losses. But as Bansal takes over, Air India’s steady loss of market share to private players will take centrestage."
"NEW DELHI : Never in the appointment of a new chairman of the railway board have the responses been so undisputed. “The right man for the right job” was a common remark heard Wednesday evening after the government issued an order nominating the chairman and managing director of Air India, Ashwani Lohani, to the post, replacing AK Mittal who stepped down in light of the two back-to-back train derailments. Reasons for Lohani drawing such effusive praises are not far to find. A 1980-batch officer of the Indian Railways Service of Mechanical Engineers, Lohani has not only earned the reputation of being the “turnaround man” but is also respected for his “interpersonal skills”. But things will not be easy for him in his new role. Rail finances are worrying, with the operating ratio (paisa spent against every rupee earned) currently placed at 94%. Lohani will need to work out strategies to improve it. Revamp/ restructure plans initiated by railways minister Suresh Prabhu have reached a halfway house. Rail bureaucracy seems directionless and distracted at this point. Lohani will need to work towards instilling a fresh work culture. Lohani is a multi-faceted personality: Acutting-edgemanager who is credited to have brought about the turnaround of the India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) and the Madhya Pradesh State Tourism Development Corporation (MPSTDC) during his previous stints; a steam enthusiast, who was instrumental in putting up Indian rail on the world heritage map by upgrading the “steam shed” at Rewari. It was because of Lohani’s initiatives that the Fairy Queen, the world’s oldest steam engine, had a run on Indian tracks – setting the Guinness record in 1998. During his stint as the CMD of Air India, the national carrier posted operational profit in 2015-16 for the first time after its merger. The airline improved its passenger services, besides expanding to various domestic and international destinations. With Limca National Record for four engineering degree, Lohani is a qualified chartered mechanical engineer from UK-based Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and holds degrees in electrical engineering, metallurgical engineering from the Institute of Engineers of India.

"NEW DELHI : Never in the appointment of a new chairman of the railway board have the responses been so undisputed. “The right man for the right job” was a common remark heard Wednesday evening after the government issued an order nominating the chairman and managing director of Air India, Ashwani Lohani, to the post, replacing AK Mittal who stepped down in light of the two back-to-back train derailments. Reasons for Lohani drawing such effusive praises are not far to find. A 1980-batch officer of the Indian Railways Service of Mechanical Engineers, Lohani has not only earned the reputation of being the “turnaround man” but is also respected for his “interpersonal skills”. But things will not be easy for him in his new role. Rail finances are worrying, with the operating ratio (paisa spent against every rupee earned) currently placed at 94%. Lohani will need to work out strategies to improve it. Revamp/ restructure plans initiated by railways minister Suresh Prabhu have reached a halfway house. Rail bureaucracy seems directionless and distracted at this point. Lohani will need to work towards instilling a fresh work culture. Lohani is a multi-faceted personality:Acutting-edgemanager who is credited to have brought about the turnaround of the India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) and the Madhya Pradesh State Tourism Development Corporation (MPSTDC) during his previous stints; a steam enthusiast, who was instrumental in putting up Indian rail on the world heritage map by upgrading the “steam shed” at Rewari. It was because of Lohani’s initiatives that the Fairy Queen, the world’s oldest steam engine, had a run on Indian tracks – setting the Guinness record in 1998. During his stint as the CMD of Air India, the national carrier posted operational profit in 2015-16 for the first time after its merger. The airline improved its passenger services, besides expanding to various domestic and international destinations. With Limca National Record for four engineering degree, Lohani is a qualified chartered mechanical engineer from UK-based Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and holds degrees in electrical engineering, metallurgical engineering from the Institute of Engineers of India.

"New Delhi [India], Aug.24 (ANI): The resident doctors at Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi went on strike for indefinite period on Wednesday after their colleague was allegedly manhandled by the attendants of a patient.

The emergency services were also interrupted at the hospital.

The strike badly affected the patients who were asked to return from the emergency gate by the security guards without being treated.

A resident doctor was allegedly assaulted by a patient in the Out Patient Department (OPD) of the hospital on Wednesday.

The resident doctors said that they called for strike to oppose such assault and to get their security concerns fulfilled.

“Around 2:30 in the afternoon, a patient assaulted a doctor alleging that his treatment was being delayed by the doctor. Such incidents are not new to us. Earlier also we witnessed such violence. Our security should be increased to check such attacks. We will go for indefinite strike till are demands are fulfilled,” Dheer Singh, president of Safdurjung resident doctors, told ANI.

"New Delhi, August 24: Under the new system of centralised counselling introduced under Supreme Court’s order this year, more than 50 per cent seats for MBBS are vacant this year in deemed universities and private colleges. Seats for dental courses are also less than 85 per cent, says Times of India. The number of admissions that has dropped this year was observed after the third round of counselling that ended on Thursday.

The final round to fill the vacant seats is scheduled for August 28, post 5 pm. The admission process for MBBS and Dental course will end on August 31. On the other hand, government colleges will get a chance to fill more seats as they will be transferred to the states. The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) which is conducting counselling is looking out for a legal option to sort the crisis of these unfilled seats in private colleges, said a senior health ministry official. “The counselling has been undertaken as per the apex court’s order and guidelines, and no changes are possible to tackle the issue of unfilled seats. We are going to seek legal opinion and also approach the court again. Otherwise, there is a possibility of up to 12,000 seats remaining unfilled this year”, said a senior DGHS official.

For every 10 vacant seats, the DGHS is going to release a list of 100 candidates which is 10 times higher. However, the similar process of first three rounds for the admission has given nothing to these deemed and private universities. Hence, they expect that less than 10 per cent of vacant seats will be filled even if DGHS tries to sort this crisis. “Till last year, deemed universities had the option of choosing their students,” said the vice-chancellor of a deemed university in Hyderabad as quoted by TOI."
"New Delhi: A day after Ravi Venkatesan, independent director and co-chairman of Infosys, met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, the market was abuzz with strong rumours of Nandan Nilekani, one of its founders, returning as chairman of the company. Nilekani left the $10-billion information technology firm in 2009 to take charge at the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the implementing agency of Aadhaar.Domestic Institutional Investors have written to Infosys seeking his return. The letter mentions that Nilekani is a credible leader among customers, employees and all other stakeholders, and can amicably settle the ongoing tussle between the Board and management. Former Infosys CFO and current chairman of Manipal Global Education T V Mohandas Pai said that Nilekani’s comeback would augur well for the company.Full report in DNA Money"
"New Delhi: As many as 12 fund managers, representing institutional investors in Infosys, have suggested bringing co-founder and former CEO Nandan Nilekani back on the board of the IT major to restore confidence of stakeholders and help resolve the crisis.

This is the second major pitch for bringing back Nilekani after an investor advisory firm IiAS said the co-founder, who had served as CEO between March 2002 to April 2007 and later went on to head the UIDAI, should be brought back on the Infosys board as its non-executive chairman.

As the crisis continues at Infosys following the sudden resignation of its first non-founder CEO Vishal Sikka amid a public spat between some founders and the top management, the companys stock crashed 15 per cent for the two straight trading sessions, eroding its market wealth by Rs 34,000 crore.

""The recent developments are very concerning to each one of us,"" the 12 fund mangers said in a joint letter, which sources said, has been written to Infosys chairman, among others.

The fund mangers said they represent several of the leading institutional investors of the country and each of these is a shareholder in Infosys.

""After considerable thought and mutual deliberations, we strongly feel that the board of Infosys should invite Nandan Nilekani to join the board in a suitable capacity,"" the letter noted. They said Nilekani enjoys confidence of various stakeholders, including customers, shareholders and employees.

""Given his credentials, we feel that his joining the board at this stage will restore confidence of stakeholders in the company and also facilitate resolution of the contentious issues that Infosys is facing presently. We do hope that you will consider the above and do the needful,"" the letter noted. The joint letter has been written by ICICI Prudential AMCs S Naren; ICICI Prudential Life Insurances Manish Kumar; HDFC MFs Prashant Jain; HDFC Life Insurances Prasun Gajri; Reliance Nippon Life AMC Sunil Singhania; SBI Funds Managements Navneet Munot and SBI Life Insurances Gopikrishna Shenoy.

Other signatories include Birla Sunlife AMCs Mahesh Patil; Anand Radhakrishnan of Franklin Templeton; Anoop Bhaskar of IDFC AMC; DSP Blackrock Investment Managers Anup Maheshwari and Kotak Mahindra AMCs Nilesh Shah.

At the end of June quarter, mutual funds held 8.95 per cent stake in Infosys and insurance companies 11.05 per cent, according to data available with the BSE. HDFC Trustee Company Ltd owned 1.99 per cent in the IT firm as of June 30, ICICI Prudential AMC (1.49 per cent), SBI (1.12 per cent), Reliance Capital Trustee Company Ltd (1.06 per cent) and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company (1.33 per cent).

The Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) last week said the Infosys board has been ""unable to protect its CEO"" and to select a successor, it must begin by ""reinventing itself"".

""It must convince Nandan Nilekani to join the board once again as its non-executive chairperson,"" it said in a report, adding that Nilekani should not see this as any other corporate job as Infosys is at the heart of Indian IT and its success will foretell how the sector will position itself for future.

Nilekani is one of the seven founders that set up Infosys more than three decades ago and served as its CEO between March 2002 to April 2007.

Sikka was brought in as the companys first non-founder CEO in June 2014, prior to which the position was held by one or the other founder."
"New Delhi: Bollywood actor Sidharth Malhotra recently became a rapper for his upcoming movie 'A Gentleman' and made the fans curious as to how the actor would sound singing for the first time.

On Wednesday, the makers of the movie unveiled the making of the song, where Sidharth is seen recording the rap in style.

In the video, the 'Baar Baar Dekho' star is seen recording for the song and discussing with the music director duo of Sachin-Jigar.

Sidharth shared the video by tweeting, ""This rap made the song special for me thanks to @SachinJigarLive #BandookMeriLaila @foxstarhindi @TSeries.""

The actor looked pumped up and totally elated while recording the song.

The composers were totally impressed with Sid's baritone and had no inhibitions on recording the rap with him.

Earlier, Sachin Sanghavi said it was his idea to get Sidharth to rap, because the actor understands the genre of hip hop and raps to a great extent.

He said, ""We discussed a lot about music in general in the studio and if given a chance once again, we would love to collaborate with him again. He has a baritone voice which is hard to miss. We are very excited with the kind of music we have scored for 'A Gentleman'. It's very experimental and diverse and we are touching upon every genre possible.""

Helmed by Krishna D.K. and Raj Nidimoru, 'A Gentleman' stars Sidharth Malhotra and Jacqueline Fernandez in lead roles.

The film is scheduled to hit the screens on August 25."
"NEW DELHI: Even as Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd threatens to upend the Indian telecom market with disruptive moves, its contribution to the government exchequer in terms of licence fee and spectrum usage charges continues to be negligible. It has paid ₹47.81 crore to the government as license fee and spectrum usage charge in the six months ended June, according to data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai). That compares with the ₹2,902.75 crore paid by Bharti Airtel Ltd; ₹2,005.25 crore by Vodafone India Ltd; and ₹1,677.67 crore by Idea Cellular Ltd. Telcos pay roughly 8% of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) as licence fee and an additional 3% as spectrum usage charges, which are the two key avenues of government earnings from the telecom industry. “There were no earnings in the March quarter as services were free to the customers. Then, started the transition towards paid services, which started to generate revenues. Also, if you have noticed, Jio’s AGR is in the negative and till the time it is negative, they will only pay fixed amount to the government,” a person familiar with Jio’s plans said, requesting anonymity. The situation should improve from this quarter, the person said. “The reason why they are showing negative AGR is because of the high number of outgoing calls from their network for which they are paying 14 paise IUC (interconnect usage charge). Therefore, licence fee and spectrum charges are paid on AGR and if AGR is negative, they will pay at minimum level,” a second person from the industry said, also requesting anonymity. Jio did not respond to an email seeking comments. Indian telecom companies are in the middle of a fierce battle to protect their turf after the entry of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which has disrupted the market and turned the tide in favour of data through free offers in the beginning and later with ultra-cheap mobile phones that went on sale in the beginning of March. Telecom companies have repeatedly complained against Jio’s free offers since its launch in September. Jio initially offered free voice calls and data until the end of 2016 in a promotional offer. The company later extended the offers to 31 March and further to June-end, which has now been rolled back. Disruption caused by Jio has wiped off significant revenues of telcos, including that of market leader Bharti Airtel. Idea is now merging with Vodafone India to become the country’s largest telecom service provider. Revenues of telcos will decline further by as much as 6% in 2017-18, according to Icra. The fall in revenue will be led by a sharper decline in revenues for smaller operators such as Tata Teleservices Ltd, Aircel Ltd and Reliance Communications Ltd."
"NEW DELHI: In a landmark judgement, the Supreme Court nine-judge constitution unanimously said that privacy is a fundamental right which will protect citizens’ personal freedom from intrusions by the state.

A nine judge bench in 9:0 verdict held that privacy is a part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 and is also protected under freedom of part 3 of the Constitution.

Pronouncing the verdict in a packed courtroom Justice J Chelameswar, reading out the verdict for the nine-judge bench said, “This right to privacy is protected under Article 21 and it is intrinsic to the Constitution,” said

Article 21 guarantees life and liberty of an individual under the constitution.

CJI Khehar said this verdict was not written by him but it was unanimous and signed one of the six judgements written in the case.

The court overruled findings in two previous verdicts namely MP Sharma and Kharak Singh case that privacy is not a fundamental right.

READ THE JUDGMENT BELOW:

The 8-judge bench judgment in 1954 in M P Sharma case ruled that privacy is not a fundamental right and is not correct in law.

This verdict will come as a blow to centre which had argued that privacy is not a fundamental right.

Now, another bench of apex court will test validity of Aadhaar on the touchstone of privacy as a fundamental right and will see whether government’s various schemes of making aadhaar mandatory holds any good in law.

The historic verdict may also have an implication on the pending section 377 which criminalises gay sex.

Meanwhile, Attorney general K K Venugopal, who had argued that right to privacy cannot be a fundamental right, welcomed the apex court decision.

The ruling came on a bunch of petitions that challenge the mandatory use of Aadhaar cards to every citizen in social welfare schemes of government."

"NEW DELHI: Railway minister offered to quit on Wednesday following two train accidents in five days.  PM 's pointed response that he should wait —while not rejecting the resignation — set off intense speculation over a Cabinet reshuffle that could be a major exercise ahead of the 2019 polls.  The train accident at Khatauli in western UP on August 19 that killed 23 people was followed by revelations of appalling negligence by railway staff. On Wednesday, 74 people were injured when 12 coaches of the Azamgarh-Delhi Kaifiyat Express derailed in UP's Auraiya district after hitting a dumper.  The two accidents have already claimed one high-profile scalp — railway board chairman A K Mittal stepped down following a nudge from the government. He has been replaced with Ashwani Lohani, chairman and managing director of Air India, who is originally from the Indian Railway Mechanical Engineering department.     ""I met the prime minister taking full moral responsibility. PM has asked me to wait,"" tweeted. Significantly, he disclosed that the PM did not turn down his offer straightaway.         's response takes on significance as Prabhu was inducted into the government when he was not even a member of BJP, let alone Parliament, and given charge of railways — a priority area for the PM who cherishes his links with the railways from the days when he hawked tea on a platform and when he was an itinerant RSS pracharak.  The PM's non-commital response to railway minister Suresh Prabhu's offer to quit was grist for simmering speculation about a shakeup of the Union cabinet being round the corner to fill up crucial vacancies, punish non-performers and reward allies, both new ones as well as potential ones like AIADMK.  The two accidents provided a fresh handle to the opposition which was already gunning for Prabhu. Though the number of accidents during Prabhu's tenure declined, mishaps at regular intervals attracted the charge that he was not able to enforce accountability in railway brass and its feuding branches.  In a series of emotional tweets, Prabhu said he was ""extremely pained"" by the two derailments in Uttar Pradesh. ""In less than three years as minister, I have devoted my blood and sweat for the betterment of the railways. Under the leadership of the PM, I tried to overcome decades of neglect through systemic reforms in all areas leading to unprecedented investment and milestones,"" he said. If Prabhu goes, this would be the second time he would have quit as minister.  He had to go as power minister in the Vajpayee government because the Shiv Sena leadership wanted him to be replaced with a more ""pragmatic"" person.  As railway minister, Prabhu did a lot in terms of managing long-term finance, focusing on hygiene and passenger amenities and preparing a blueprint for upgrade of platforms and stations.  Prabhu, sources said, could not handle the stubborn railway bureaucracy and get a fix on festering issues like the feuding between electric and loco units. He viewed his role as a minister as only to frame broader policies and managing finances for the transporter and delegated all administrative powers to the railway board and zonal railways. But Prabhu was seen by the railway bureaucracy as someone who wanted to abdicate responsibility by not engaging himself in the rough and tumble of running trains."
"New Delhi: The creamy layer ceiling for Other Backward Classes candidates for securing government jobs was on Wednesday raised to Rs 8 lakh as the union cabinet cleared a proposal for a commission to work out sub-categorisation within OBCs for a ""more equitable distribution of reservation benefits"". Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said after a cabinet meeting here that OBC families earning up to Rs 8 lakh per annum will not be considered in the creamy layer. Earlier, this ceiling was Rs 6 lakh per annum.

Asked if the raised limit will also be applicable to public sector undertakings, Jaitley said the issue was under ""active consideration of the government"". Jaitley said the cabinet approved a proposal for setting up of a commission under article 340 of the Constitution to examine the issue of sub-categorisation of the OBCs. He said the commission will examine the extent of inequitable distribution of benefits of reservation among the castes or communities included in the broad category of OBCs, with reference to the OBCs included in the Central list. It will work out the mechanism and parameters for sub-categorisation within such OBCs, identify the respective castes or communities or sub-castes in the central list of OBCs and classify them into their respective sub-categories. ""With this, those in the broad category of OBCs who were till now devoid of benefits of reservation, will get the benefits. There will be more equitable distribution,"" he said. The commission will submit its report within 12 weeks from the date of appointment of the Chairperson. Jaitley said the National Commission for Backward Classes had given its recommendation in 2011 that there should be sub-categorisaion and the Parliamentary Standing Committee had also given such a recommendation. The Supreme Court, in its November 1992 order, had observed that there is no Constitutional or legal bar to a state categorising backward classes as backward or more backward. The Minister said 11 states have already implemented the sub-categorisation for state level services. These are Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, Jharkhand, Puducherry, Haryana, Karnataka, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Jammu and Kashmir (for Jammu region). On whether the government is going to review the reservation mechanism, Jaitley said: ""There is no such proposal... there will be no review."" On caste census, Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thawarchand Gehlot, who was also present at the press meet, said the information about the census is with the Home Ministry.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday dismissed former Calcutta high court judge CS Karnan’s petition challenging the constitutional validity of the Contempt of Courts Act. “The challenge to the constitutionality of the Contempt of Courts Act in the present case does not lie inasmuch as the Supreme Court has not exercised power under the Contempt of Courts Act but invoked its inherent jurisdiction under Article 129 of the Constitution.”
"NEW DELHI: The government is set to constitute a commission to examine how the Central list of OBCs can be divided into sub-groups, an act that appears to be a move to win over the ""most backward castes"" by addressing their grievance of ""inequitable"" distribution of Mandal reservation benefits.  The on Wednesday approved the setting up of a commission for sub-categorisation of OBCs.  It sets the ball rolling on a proposal pending with the Centre since the ( ) made a detailed recommendation to the social justice ministry in March 2015.According to a government statement, the commission will submit its report within 12 weeks of its constitution.  According to its terms of reference, the panel will examine the degree of ""inequitable distribution of benefits of reservation"" among OBCs and suggest the mechanism for sub-categorisation.  It will also divide the list into categories.  The demand for sub-categorisation is rooted in the lament that clubbing all the ""backward castes"", irrespective of their social and financial status, under the rubric of ""OBC"" puts them at a disadvantage vis-a-vis the dominant ones in the competition for jobs and educational opportunities. The weaker backward castes — ""most backward"" — have long complained that stronger OBCs were cornering quota benefits because they were unable to compete with them owing to their weaker socio-economic status.  To redress the situation, it is suggested that the OBC list be divided into multiple categories (like backward, most backward and extremely backward) and the 27% quota quantum apportioned among them according to their population. Politically, it is expected to lead to polarisation along a ""backward vs most backward"" line.  BJP president welcomed the decision, saying, ""The sub-categories will ensure that priority can be given to communities among the OBCs which, because of their economic backwardness, are in greater need of reservation and other benefits.""  While the move will be resented by the stronger backward castes since sub-division will shrink their share of quota, it will be appreciated by the ""most backward"".  In north India, Yadavs and Kurmis would be the major losers, while ""MBCs"" would celebrate their liberation from the yoke of their stronger brethren."
"NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday named Rajiv Bansal, additional secretary in the petroleum ministry, as the interim chairman and managing director of Air India. The tenure is for three months and might be extended. The move follows the appointment of current Air India CMD Ashwani Lohani as Railway Board chairman, replacing A K Mittal, who resigned in the wake of Kaifiyat Express derailment in Uttar Pradesh. He had been reportedly asked to go on leave by the Railway ministry.

Bansal, an IAS officer of the 1988 batch, is not new to the aviation sector. He had served as a director in the aviation ministry. He has also served in the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, where he looked after digital payments, IT Act, Aadhaar, and internet governance. During 30-year career, Bansal has also served as secretary, Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, and joint secretary in the Department of Heavy Industries.

Bansal is a civil engineering graduate from IIT Delhi. He also has a diploma in finance from ICFAI, Hyderabad and an executive master in international business from Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, New Delhi.

Lohani, a 1980 batch officer of the Indian Railway Service of Mechanical Engineer, had taken charge of Air India in August 2015 when AI was plagued by unresolved issues related to the Air India-Indian Airlines merger leading to low employee morale.

"New Delhi: The Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind has opposed the path-breaking Supreme Court verdict striking down the 1,400-year-old practice of instant 'triple talaq' among Sunni Muslims.

Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind described the apex court decision as violative of the ""Shariah"" and a matter of ""grave concern"" for the Muslim community.

Taking a defiant stand, Jamiat general secretary Maulana Mahmood Madani said instant triple talaq was still valid as per the Islamic code notwithstanding the Supreme Court declaring it as unconstitutional and void in law.

""Even now, if a man administers instant talaq, it will come into effect as per Shariah for those who believe in it,"" he told reporters here.

A five-judge Constitution bench, by a majority of 3:2 in which the Chief Justice JS Khehar found himself in a minority, said in a one line order: ""In view of the different opinions recorded by a majority of 3:2, the practice of 'talaq-e-biddat' or triple talaq is set aside.""

With triple talaq being set aside, now Sunni Muslims, among whom the practice was prevalent, will not be able to take recourse to this mode as it would be ""void ab initio"" (illegal at the outset).

They are now left with two other modes of securing divorce - 'talaq hasan' and 'talaq ahsan' after the apex court today set aside the triple talaq.

Under 'talaq ahsan', a Muslim man can divorce his spouse by pronouncing 'talaq' once every month in three consecutive months, which would be signified by menstruation cycles.

As per 'talaq hasan', divorce can be given by pronouncing talaq ""during successive tuhrs (menstruation cycles)"" with no intercourse during any of the three tuhrs.

Chief Justice JS Khehar and Justice S Abdul Nazeer constituting the minority in the five-bench Constitutional bench ordered an injunction on triple talaq at least for six months -- by when the government should consider steps to initiate legislation on the issue.

The other three judges disagreed.

"New York: Former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova makes her first Grand Slam appearance next week since serving a 15- month doping suspension, bringing renewed passion and resolve to the US Open. The 30- year- old Russian was given a wild card into the tournament by the US Tennis Association ( USTA), a move critics complained about earlier in the season but another key step in the road back for the fivetime Grand Slam winner. "" When it comes to tennis, good or bad — there's really only one thing that I know for certain — I've missed it,"" Sharapova wrote on the Players' Tribune website. "" Though these last two years have been tougher — so much tougher — than I ever could have anticipated... My passion for the game has never wavered. If anything, it has only grown stronger."" Sharapova was issued a two- year suspension after testing positive for the banned heart and bloodboosting drug meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS) reduced the ban on appeal. She said that she had taken it for several years and did not know it had been placed on the banned list at the start of 2016. Sharapova made her return in April at Stuttgart, reaching the semi- finals as a wild card, but such invitations sparked criticism from some WTA rivals, saying she should have to work her way back without such benefits, some suggesting a life ban. "" I'm aware of what many of my peers have said about me and how critical of me some of them have been,"" she wrote. "" If you're a human being with a normal, beating heart... I don't think that sort of thing will ever fully be possible to ignore."" Sharapova was refused a wild card by French Open organisers and missed Wimbledon with a thigh injury, so the US Open will be her first Grand Slam event since last year's Australian Open. Shaking off criticism after the French Open snub, Sharapova tweeted: "" If this is what it takes to rise up again, then I am in it all the way, everyday. No words, games or actions will ever stop me from reaching my own dreams. And I have many."" Sharapova has missed three of the past four US Opens, her last visit ending in the 2014 fourth round. The USTA defended its wild card offer, saying, "" Her suspension under the terms of the tennis anti- doping programme was completed and therefore was not one of the factors weighed in our wildcard selection process. Consistent with past practice, a wild card was provided to a past US champion who needed the wild card for entry into the main draw."" Sharapova won the 2006 US Open as well as Wimbledon in 2004, the 2008 Australian Open and the 2012 and 2014 French Opens. "" I'm sure this is a great moment for her to have an opportunity to be back to a place where she has done so well,"" seven- time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams said. Sharapova was bolstered by fans with "" Welcome back Maria"" signs in Germany and cheering support last month in Stanford, her first US match in more than two years. ( AGENCIES) Maria Sharapova"
"NEWDELHI: By his second year at IIT-Kanpur, Sambhav Karnawat was decided on two things: he wanted to have his own business and he wanted to return to Jaipur. So the start-up germ was seeded in him. Four years after graduating as an engineer in 2012, Sambhav founded Jewelove, an online site for platinum jewellery. A family background of jewellery business has helped the 27-year-old, whose start-up is so far self-funded. Jalandhar’s Harshvardhan Tiwari did not have a family business or deep pockets to fall back on. But he and Sambhav have two things in common: an engineering degree and a lack of interest in the jobs that campus placements threw up. During his days at Lovely Professional University, Tiwari and his friends took a trip to Manali and the idea of ZORoute, an intercity cab aggregator was born. It is the Karnawats that Narendra Modi is banking on when he says, “We are nurturing our youngsters to be job creators and not job seekers”, from Red Fort on August 15. To push private investment and to create jobs, the Modi government has sought to fire the start-up dream with tax incentives, reduction in patent registration fees, better access to public projects and easier clearances. The association of IT and BPO industry, NASSCOM said that start-ups are poised to create 2.5 lakh jobs by 2020 but that was an estimate in 2015 before investors tightened their purse strings. “Presently start-ups account for only 80,000 jobs. Experience in other countries like US and Israel show that start-ups have the potential to create hundred thousand jobs. But this leap from thousands to hundred thousand will take decades,” said a government official. Data on venture capital (VC) investment in new start-ups shows a graph that was on a steep ascent from 2013 to 2015 but has been nose diving since 2016. Gone are the heady days of 2015 when VCs invested $2 billion in more than 550 new ideas and start-ups; that number is down to just 209 deals in eight months of 2017 that shows investment of just $785 million. Today cautiousness has set in; investors have realised only a really innovative idea will succeed and give returns on investments, in a country that sees at least four start-ups being conceived every month. But start-ups can live up to the Prime Minister’s expectation of becoming job creators only if they get the right funding at the right time by displaying the right innovation. A real innovative idea is rare. A start-up can be successful only when it solves an intractable problem in a way that reduces cost and increases convenience. And the worth of a start-up is because while solving a problem, it will create direct and ancillary jobs. The trick for entrepreneurs is to identify the sector where government initiatives lack and technology could solve problems. The examples are many: agriculture, education, healthcare, etc. But with the success of e-commerce, incubators say that most youngsters are only interested in retailbased start-ups. Data shows that of the 800 start-ups recognised by the government so far, only 10 were eligible for the financial benefits under Startup India, Standup India programme. Officials say that innovation, a key criteria for being chosen was missing. And that is why the government is thinking of linking job creation as the main factor for start-ups to be eligible for federal benefits. “A large number of applications come to us only because they want ‘apna kuchh’. Of the almost 1,000 applications that we have got this year, only 100 are worth incubating. Of this, perhaps only 20 will get investor attention and funding”, said Chintan Bakshi, COO of Rajasthanbased incubator, Startup Oasis. SECTOR IN NASCENT PHASE Why don’t all start-ups stand up, is a question that haunts Mohali’s Harshvardhan Tiwari. ZORoute is his second attempt at entrepreneurship. Unlike Karnawat, who got support from his family business, Tiwari has the burden of arranging investment for his start-up. Of the 12,000 start-ups that applied for investment, Indian Angel Network (IAN), one of the largest network of angel investors in Asia, invested in only 40. “It takes time for the start-up ecosystem to mature. So a high rejection list in the formative years of the sector is natural. India’s largest private job creator, the IT sector was also a bunch of start-ups in the 1980s, with the exception of Tata Consultancy Services. Did the sector become a $150 billion industry creating 4 million jobs, overnight?” asks Saurabh Srivastava, founder of IAN and co-founder of NASSCOM. The answer is no. And the expansion from a $50 million sector in 1988 to an over $150 billion industry has taken three decades for the IT sector. With the right nurturing these startups could grow into larger industrial houses fulfilling Modi’s wish of largescale job creation. But Modi’s wish will have to wait, today the start-up sector is still in its nascent phase, which is already seeing cautious investors and a large number of them not maturing beyond an idea. Data shows that one out of every seven start-up idea does not get funding for growing into a business. POLICIES TO EASE BUSINESS India’s role model in the case of start-ups is the Silicon Valley. But politicians and policymakers should remember that it took decades before the Valley became the net new job creators in America. To help the start-up sector mature, the government has to ensure several facilitating policies. The education sector has started realising the importance of innovation in its syllabi but it has to be more enabling. The government has to take ease of doing business several notches higher where setting up and winding up of businesses do not take too much time. Legal protection against busting startups also has to be made a priority. The examples of Stayzilla, where the founder was jailed for a civil offence of not paying a vendor, does not inspire the entrepreneurial spirit. Jewelove’s Sambhav Karnawat has already expanded his team from three to over 100 people he directly and indirectly employs. He wants to expand his workforce to 1,000, but that will happen gradually over the next five years. And for that, his wishlist to Prime Minister Modi’s government is to ensure easy and timely access to the government’s start-up funding schemes."
"NEWDELHI: The railways stared at a shake-up as its board chairman resigned and minister Suresh Prabhu offered to quit on Wednesday after back-to-back train derailments hit India’s largest public transporter. Air India chairman and managing director Ashwani Lohani was appointed chairman of the Railway Board after incumbent AK Mittal resigned, citing personal reasons. Lohani is an Indian Railway Service officer of the 1980 batch. He has four engineering degrees. The petroleum and natural gas ministry’s financial adviser, Rajiv Bansal, was named the new head of the ailing national airline. He is a 1988-batch IAS officer from the Nagaland cadre. Prabhu met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and offered to resign, but there is no official confirmation if it was accepted. It is likely that Modi will ask him to continue until the next reshuffle of the Union cabinet. “I met the Hon’ble Prime Minister @narendramodi taking full moral responsibility,” Prabhu tweeted. The Prime Minister asked him to wait, he said and added in another tweet that he was “deeply pained” by the train disasters. More than 70 people were injured as 10 coaches of the Kaifiyat Express bound for New Delhi jumped tracks after colliding with a dumper truck in Uttar PraMonday, desh’s Auraiya early Wednesday. Apart from this, a train collided with a lorry at an unmanned crossing in Tamil Nadu’s Villupuram and a Mumbai-bound train travelled 2km on a wrong route in Odisha, which could have turned disastrous had there been another one approaching.

"Nine days ago, India demolished Sri Lanka in the final Test here inside three days to complete a 3-0 Test series sweep. The two sides return to the same venue for the second match of the ODI series on Thursday, with nothing having changed in between. India went 1-0 up in the ODI series with yet another demolition in Damdulla on Sunday. The difference in the ICC rankings of the two sides has clearly been reflected on the field so far. And there is little chance of any change in the script in the upcoming matches. If Sri Lanka are seeking some inspiration, they can look back at the decent start they made in the first match, racing to 74 in the first 14 overs without losing a wicket. But they then surrendered the match by collapsing like a pack of cards in the middle overs -losing nine wickets for 77 runs in a span of 19 overs. It will be an uphill task for the hosts to lift themselves up after suffering such big losses in recent times. India, on the other hand, are on a roll. Everything has clicked for them on this tour so far. And, importantly, the players still look hungry and there is no indication of them taking the foot off the pedal. Having approached this series with an eye on the 2019 World Cup, they could be tempted to try something different. As far as the combination is concerned, skipper Virat Kohli said, “there is no reason to change the team after just one game if the pitch is similar to the one in Dambulla.“ However, with Kuldeep Yadav having bowled well to pick up five wickets in the Pallekele Test, the team management could mull playing him. To make room for the chinaman bowler, though, Kohli will have to axe either left-arm Axar Patel, who was very impressive in the first ODI, or leggie Yuzvendra Chahal unless the think-tank opts for a three-pronged spin attack -which is unlikely on a pitch that helps pacers. The only area of concern for India could be their new-ball bowlers as both Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Hardik Pandya went for runs in the early overs. Kohli indicated that he will give Pandya the new ball again, even though bowling coach Bharath Arun said on Tuesday that to bowl the full quota of 10 overs, Pandya needs to work more on his skills. “Quite possible, because Hardik has the ability to swing the ball and can bowl consistently over 135 kmph. We certainly look at him in that position as a great option for us,“ Kohli said at the match-ever press conference. Desperate for a positive result, Sri Lanka skipper Upul Tharanga said “there certainly will be changes in the side.“ However, openers Danushka Gunathilaka and Niroshan Dickwella, along with Kusal Mendis, will once again hold the key in their batting lineup. “To get to a big total, we need the top four batsmen to fire. One or two of them must make a big score,“ Tharanga said. The skipper also has to take responsibility , after having got out to a soft dismissal in Game 1."

"Officials of two bus depots in south Mumbai have been accused of fudging records of daily bus turnout to show that some buses are plying on city roads when they are actually lying idle at depots. BEST committee chairman Anil Kokil told a committee meeting he had received a written complaint from Rajesh Kusale (Shiv Sena) that records were being fudged to show a higher turnout of buses at the depots. Kokil demanded a detailed inquiry .BEST general manager Surendrakumar Bagde said he will probe the matter. Kusale said at least eight buses were lying idle at the Colaba and Backbay depots but records showed they were out on duty . “This is unwarranted. We must find out how this benefits officials and suspend the guilty ,“ he said. Sunil Ganacharya (BJP) pointed out that 36% electronic ticket-issuing machines were defective and earnings were being hit. TOI had highlighted the issue on August 12. “We have reverted to paper tickets in these buses. We have a stock of paper tickets for 22 days. Surprisingly , the management ordered printing of more paper tickets when they should replace the machines,“ he said. Bagde said efforts were on to rectify the 3,398 machines and ensure buses don't leave depots without them; earnings have not been affected. A fare hike proposal was circulated to members but discussions were deferred. 50 routes off map BEST has taken 50 loss-making routes off the city map temporarily and redeployed buses on busy routes to earn more revenue.Regular commuters in SoBo and the suburbs may be affected.An official told TOI it was a trade-off between unsatisfied commuters, who were fewer, and satisfied ones, who were regular office-goers.

"On a Friday afternoon this month, Milind Kothari looked at his WhatsApp message with a furrowed brow.The India head of BDO, a leading professional services firm, had received a message from his turnaround and business support partner, Sundaresh Bhat, who had just taken over ABG Shipyard as interim resolution professional (IRP) on an order by the National Company Law Tribunal. Bhat had found himself in a tough position after he reached Dahej, Gujarat, to take stock of things at the company . As soon as he reached its premises, he was surrounded by about 200 angry workers, who said they had not been paid by the company for 18 months.At the Mumbai office, Kothari, after reading his colleague's messages, was fearful that Bhat may be manhandled by the angry mob.“In their mind, I was the new owner of the company , it's way too complicated for me to explain how insolvency works to angry workers and staff surrounding me,“ Bhat said. Thankfully for Bhat, the situation did not blow out of proportion as he was able to calm the tempers. “Somehow I managed to pacify the workers and told them that I have been appointed by the court.With reluctance they agreed to cooperate,“ said Bhat. BDO is working with three companies -Jyoti Structures, Bhushan Power & Steel and ABG Shipyard -that are into insolvency proceedings. Professionals brought in by lenders to handle the transition in insolvency proceedings are finding themselves reeled in situations they had not bargained for.So, from facing threats of violence to bribe and handling angry mobs to pacifying borrowers have become part of their job. “People's expectations are sky high on day one, they think the professionals will arrive with solutions to all their problems -funding, turnaround plan, everything. So, suppliers, employees, other operational creditors and in some cases even customers tend to flock to the IRPs,“ said an IRP at one of the companies. KPMG's Anuj Jain, the insolvency professional at Jaypee Infratech, has had several meetings with irate home buyers and the first couple of meetings were rocky. Flooded with unending queries, the firm quickly put up FAQs on the company's website to inform home buyers about recent regulatory changes. Executives at EY, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG, Grant Thornton, BDO and Alvarez & Marsal are appoin ted in 12 high-profile insolvency cases currently under process. In most cases, the partners in these firms have taken up as insolvency professionals who would head the companies for the next six months. “Just how many people can the IPs meet? They don't realise that the IPs aren't here to liquidate the company but to facilitate a viable turnaround plan which would be in best interest of the key stakeholders,“ said Ashish Chhawchharia, partnerrestructuring services, Grant Thornton Advisory Pvt Ltd. TIME-BOUND RESOLUTION “People get confused between liquidation and resolution. The intention of the insolvency and bankruptcy code is to work out a time-bound resolution, and only in the event that a time-bound resolution cannot be worked out that the company may go into liquidation,“ added Sanjay Doshi, partner, KPMG in India. Promoters are also having difficulty in getting used to a situation where they are not in charge and need the IP's approval for things.Never in India had there been a situation where the creditor had the control, said Chhawchharia. Some operational creditors or suppliers are also calling insolvency professionals and offering bribes, say people in the know.These creditors may not even get 10% of the total amount the companies owe them, mainly because lenders have seniority in a settlement. Firms on their part are trying to handle the situation. In some instances -like in the case of PwC -bodyguards have been provided to the partners acting as resolution professional. In most of the situations, these professionals face morchas and agitations by workers, their families and others when they visit the site. “This is not what we bargained for,“ said a partner at a consultancy currently working as an insolvency professional. Consulting firms and lawyers working with them are set to make about Rs 200 crore from the 12 insolvency proceedings that are being seen as the starting template for a potentially Rs 8 lakh crore recovery exercise in the stretched banking system. These professionals are charging Rs 1-1.25 crore per month per company, something that may just not be enough for the problems they face, said some partners."

A total of 85 central companies along with thousands of policemen on the ground will maintain a tight vigil, especially in the vulnerable areas of Moga, Bathinda, Sangrur, Barnala, Patiala and Ludhiana, the spokesperson added.

The CM has asked the police officials to fan out across the sensitive districts to ensure that there is no disruption of the law and order in the state in view of the impending order.

Security has been tightened along the state's borders with Haryana, as well as the connecting roads to prevent any incursions, the spokesperson stated.

The CM has ordered senior officers to personally monitor the situation on the ground, with the DGP visiting the various sensitive districts to review the preparations ahead of the verdict in the sensitive case.

He also ordered the DGP intelligence to ensure strict monitoring of social media and effectively thwart any attempts by rumour mongers to spread unrest.

The police have seized five walkie-talkies from suspected Dera followers and are moving to identify the various locations suspected to be housing dangerous weapons of any kind.

Captain Amarinder Singh has meanwhile once again appealed to the people to maintain peace at all costs and not to get provoked by elements trying to disrupt the state's law and order.

The godman was accused with rape charges of a female devotee in 1999. The CBI took over the investigation in 2002. On 17 August, the special CBI court of Panchkula concluded hearing in the case but reserved pronouncing the verdict for 25 August.

For the August 17 hearing, Singh was recused from appearing in person at Panchkula by the court. The Dera chief had cited medical reasons for not attending court in person.

The case was registered by the CBI in 2002 against the self-styled godman after allegations of sexual exploitation of two women followers through anonymous letters.

The hearing has been going on since 2007."

"On Wednesday night Dodgers pitcher Rich Hill lost his bid for a perfect game and subsequently his chance at a no-hitter in one of the most heartbreaking games of baseball you'll ever witness . It will surely go down as the greatest pitching performances in a loss in the history of baseball.

But before the night turned tragic, Hill had some help, most notably from veteran second baseman Chase Utley, whose flash of the glove in the eighth inning would save Hill's perfect game for the moment.

With no outs in the inning, Pirates first baseman Josh Bell hit a shot toward second that for a moment felt like the end of Hill's pursuit of perfection, only for Utley to make a diving catch that would have gone down as the defining defensive moment of this game had the perfect game come to fruition.

As the announcer's call goes: ""CHASE UTLEY... OH MY GOODNESS... He saved the day for now.""

For an instant after Utley came down with the ball, it felt like perfection was simply in the air, and inevitable outcome for one of the hottest teams in regular season baseball history.

Sadly for Hill, Utley, and the rest of the Dodgers, the announcer's call would prove foreboding. Hill would lose the perfect game in the ninth after an error by third baseman Logan Forsythe, and give up the no-hitter and the win in the tenth inning with a walk-off to Josh Harrison.

Rich Hill had pitched nine no-hit innings only to take the loss, and Utley left the game with a defensive highlight that will go unremarked in the history books besides a possible spot on tomorrow's SportsCenter Top 10.

The Dodgers and Pirates will face off again on Thursday."
"Online services being offered by Pune police are being received well by citizens, data has revealed. Services on punepolice.co.in include registration of lost items, logging of tenant information and filing of police complaints. Tops officials maintain citizen response has been encouraging. They said the online route was also aimed at fas USER ter reporting of complaints. Data compiled by the cyber cell revealed the most used service so far was registration of lost and found articles. Over 23,000 users have used the facility since it launched in May. An average of 10 citizens use the online service every day -reporting the loss of everything from mobile phones to wallets. The increase in number of complaints is substantial because brick-and mortar police stations were earlier recording just about one lost complaint from citizens every day . The other facility that has gained popularity is the tenant information registration, with more than 20,000 users logged in since its launch on May 30. Statistics indicate a month-on-month in crease in the uptake of the facility , and a daily us age of almost 250. The online complaint system SURGE is still to gather steam though, po lice records reveal. Experts put it down to a lack of awareness about the service, but are hopeful of boosting numbers in the months ahead. Police commissioner Rashmi Shukla believes `online' is the way to go. Expressing satisfaction with the revamped police service, she said, “Polic ing is changing for the better in the city . We are trying to be more accessible and sensitive to the changing requirements of the citizens“."
"Only the date line changes. Exactly a week ago, London, Paris, Brussels, Dhaka, Delhi, Islamabad respectfully made way for Barcelona. `Mowing down tourists is the new normal' despaired the Evening Standard while Londoners sat transfixed to the toofamiliar photograph of a bloodied avenue. Las Ramblas, the very metaphor of hedonism, had been bustling with carefree crowds when a van emerged like a bat out of hell ­ driven with a fervour linked to the promise of heaven. The next Monday , a bomb alert evacuated the same stretch. East and West have met in terror. True, each had had enough of its own, but now it's of a common genre. What demons ­ or angels ­ drive 22-year-olds to get behind a wheel and ram coldly into unsuspecting strangers? And how alert can we be when jihad comes via such everyday objects as a van, kitchen knife ­ or the tiffin box bombs of Mumbai and Delhi. This column swells from my time on the Ramblas, my awe over something as civilised as a 1.2 km thoroughfare dedicated to pedestrians, leaving vehicles to fend for themselves on its margins. My first encounter with this incredible boulevard came at an international AIDS conference in 2002.It was where India's HIV-afflicted finally found their voice, and through which a flamboyant Shatrughan Sinha swaggered as health minister. So the many stories to be filed kept me away from Las Ramblas's tireless blandishments. But my hotel was right on it, and i went to bed with riffs of laughter and the weeping of violins. In the morning when i walked to catch my tube, it lay exhausted from its multiple orgasms. Two other visits allowed a more touristy appreciation. Of the Ramblas's gilded `statue' men, the segueing of the world's accents, the flowers, food and baubles, the eccentric Gaudi architecture just off it, and suave Hispanics seducing over La Riojas or returning from a late-late concert, the men in long formal skirts (you read that right). Now in London, my two always-must-dos are also stained by recent attacks: the Borough market and Westminster bridge. But the crowds still mill undaunted. It's the most effective thumbed-nose to terror. Or so they say .

"Our LEGAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the Board of Control for Cricket in India's ( BCCI) acting president C. K. Khanna, acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry to personally appear before it on September 17 to explain why steps had not been taken so far for implementing the Justice R. M. Lodha panel recommendations for carrying out various reforms. The apex court also asked the Committee of Administrators ( CoA) appointed by it prepare a "" draft constitution"" on the basis of the recommendations made by the Lodha panel and the July 18, 2016 judgment of the court directing implementation of the reforms. The CoA has been asked to prepare the draft constitution in consultation with senior advocate and amicus curiae Gopal Subramanium. The draft constitution would also take into consideration, the July 24 suggestions made by the top court for reconsidering some of the contentious recommendations of the panel like ' one state one vote policy', a maximum of three selectors for the national selection committee and associate membership to Railways, Services and Combined Universities. A bench of Justices Dipak Misra, A. M. Khanwilkar and D. Y. Chandrachud passed the directions after Subramanium and senior advocate Parag Tripathi appearing for the CoA complained that the Board was persistently defying the apex court's directions since July 18, 2016 for implementation of the Lodha panel recommendations. Both Tripathi and Subramanium told the court that till date the Board had not bothered to implement even a single recommendation."
"OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Guwahati, Aug. 23: There is good news for those suffering from terminal kidney ailments, with Dispur deciding to offer free dialysis in 26 district hospitals. Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma today said the dialysis facilities in the government sector that were available only at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, Silchar Medical College and Hospital and Assam Medical College and Hospital will now be extended to 26 district hospitals soon. "" It will be free of cost for those earning below Rs 5 lakh a year. It will come as a huge relief to patients,"" Sarma said. Dialysis is the process of eliminating waste and unwanted water from the blood using a dialysis apparatus after kidneys fail to function properly. The cost of a dialysis session could be anywhere between Rs 2,500 and Rs 5,000 depending on the type of hospital. Apart from announcing free dialysis, Sarma also revealed that DoNER sanctioned Rs 220 crore for the proposed Nalbari Medical College and Hospital. "" It will be a 500- bed hospital and have a student intake of 100. DoNER has sanctioned Rs 220 crore and we have identified a 100- bigha plot, 10km from town and work will start in four to five months. Of the total cost, the state government will bear 10 per cent,"" Sarma said. Nalbari is about 70km from Guwahati. As of now six medical colleges are functioning in the state while nine are either almost ready or are under construction or in planning stages. Guwahati, Silchar, Dibrugarh, Jorhat, Tezpur, Barpeta colleges are operational, Diphu is almost ready while the Lakhimpur, Nagaon and Dhubri colleges are under construction. Medical colleges have also been approved/ planned for Tinsukia, Kokrajhar and Karimganj. Sarma today said the government has reimbursed over Rs 29 crore under the Atal Amrit Abhiyan since the scheme was launched in December 25 last year with most claims coming from Kamrup district ( 996) and the least from Chirang ( 57) for six critical diseases such as kidney, cancer, burns, cardiovascular, neo- natal and neurological disorders. "" Most of the claims were related to cancer. Patients have got upto Rs 2 lakh in reimbursement, the maximum under the scheme. We received 12,477 claims and after scrutiny, will be distributing the cheques to 5,738 beneficiaries in Guwahati on October 7. On an average, patients have received upto Rs 50,000 each. We will also be ready with smart cards worth Rs 1.5 crore by December,"" Sarma said."
"OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Aug. 23: India has granted the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer a patent on a pneumonia vaccine, rejecting opposition from an Indian company and a humanitarian medical agency that said the decision would delay an affordable vaccine for the poor. The patent will allow Pfizer to exclusively sell its pneumococcal conjugated vaccine ( PCV), designed to protect against 13 types of bacteria, till 2026 and prevent other companies from producing the same vaccine. In an August 11 order, Nilanjana Mukherjee, an assistant controller of patents and designs, described the vaccine as "" novel and inventive"" and dismissed the pre- grant opposition filed by India's Panacea Biotec and Medecins Sans Frontieres ( MSF), or Doctors Without Borders. The MSF, which procures inexpensive generic drugs and vaccines from several Indian companies, yesterday decried the decision saying it would keep the PCV vaccine out of reach of millions of poor children across India and other countries. "" Many governments can't afford the prices set by Pfizer,"" Prince Mathew, Asia regional coordinator with the MSF, said through a news release. "" We need additional manufacturers to introduce competition with the aim of lowering prices."" The Indian Academy of Pediatrics recommends three doses of the PCV at six, 10 and 14 weeks of age and a booster dose in the 15th month. The PCV has been available in India for several years through private paediatricians and currently costs about Rs 3,800 ($ 59) a dose. Health experts estimate that nearly 200,000 children under five years die from pneumonia in India each year. The Union health ministry introduced the PCV in the government's immunisation programme in May this year only in three states — Bihar, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The ministry is procuring the vaccine at $ 3 a dose with funding from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, a public- private organisation, that has pledged $ 500,000 to support India's immunisation programme between 2016 and 2021. "" Even the three dollar a dose price appears too high, otherwise why would the government roll this vaccine out only in three states?"" Leena Menghaney, head of the MSF's Access Campaign in South Asia, told The Telegraph . "" The patent decision lowers the threshold of patentability and creates a precedent that could make it easier for other companies get similar patents on vaccines."" Apart from the New Delhibased Panacea Biotec, the Pune- based Serum Institute of India too has been working on a PCV vaccine. Such companies would need to find ways to develop versions that do not infringe on the Pfizer patent. An April 2016 briefing document prepared by ShareAction, a UK- based registered charity, said Pfizer and Glaxo- SmithKline currently hold a duopoly over PCVs and urged investors to engage with both companies "" to request more transparent pricing, a reduction in price of PCV vaccines and a guarantee that international humanitarian agencies have access to the lowest global price""."
"OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Aug. 23: Murmurs about an imminent cabinet shuffle grew louder today with railway minister Suresh Prabhu offering to resign and Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him to "" wait"". Sources said Prabhu's resignation offer was likely to be accepted by Modi against the backdrop of back- to- back train derailments in Uttar Pradesh. The inauspicious "" shradh "" period, before which the Prime Minister is said to be planning to effect the cabinet changes, begins on September 5. "" I met the Hon'ble Prime Minister taking full moral responsibility. Hon'ble PM has asked me to wait. I am extremely pained by the unfortunate accidents, injuries to passengers and loss of precious lives. It has caused me deep anguish,"" Prabhu tweeted today. According to the sources, some prominent ministers could be dropped and new faces inducted based on a performance review by the Prime Minister. A cabinet shuffle has also become imminent because of two heavyweight ministers taking up other assignments. Manohar Parrikar, who was defence minister, has become Goa chief minister. Venkaiah Naidu, who was in charge of the information and broadcasting and urban development ministries, has become Vice- President. The untimely demise of Anil Dave, junior environment minister, has also created a vacancy. BJP leaders said that apart from Modi, party chief Amit Shah was also informally holding meetings that could be aimed at finalising the cabinet shake- up. The sources said Modi and Shah were coordinating the shuffle with an eye on the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Shah recently cancelled his trip to Tamil Nadu to instead finalise the details of the ministry changes, according to the sources. The possibility of some important ministers being shifted to party work to take charge of the preparations for the 2019 elections is not being ruled out. Some members of Nitish Kumar's JDU, which recently broke ranks with the Opposition and joined the NDA, are also expected to be inducted into the ministry."
"OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Aug. 23: The Union cabinet today gave an in- principle approval to set up a ministerial panel to speed up consolidation among public sector banks to create strong lenders. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will name the members of the panel, which will oversee the proposals for mergers from the boards of the banks, finance minister Arun Jaitley said after the meeting of the cabinet. Earlier this year, the government had merged the State Bank of India's five subsidiaries with the country's largest lender. "" The objective is to create strong banks and the experience of bank mergers has so far been positive,"" said Jaitley. The finance minister said consolidation would prevent multiplicity of resources being spent in the same area and strengthen the banks to deal with shocks. The Centre owns majority stakes in 21 lenders, which account for more than two- thirds of the country's banking assets. But these banks also account for the lion's share of more than Rs 1.5 lakh crore in sour assets plaguing the sector, and need billions of dollars in new capital in the next two years to meet global Basel- III norms. Banking sector reforms are a major plank of Modi's administration to revive credit growth, which has slowed to multi- decade lows as banks struggle with bad loans. After an in- principle approval from the panel, banks will abide by the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Reserve Bank of India. While the alternative mechanism will help fast- track approvals, Jaitley said the onus of initiating such merger proposals would be on the boards of the banks. Officials separately indicated that the government had been conducting preliminary studies and holding talks with banks on the possible merger of the larger PSU banks with the smaller lenders, such as the Oriental Bank of Commerce, Dena Bank and Syndicate Bank. "" There are studies on manpower, technology merger of various banks… we have to take them forward,"" said officials. The government hopes the wave of mergers it wants to usher in will help state- run banks to reduce their bad loan portfolio and achieve operational efficiency. Rating agency Crisil said the new mechanism was an important first step towards kick- starting the consolidation process. While analysts and investors have hailed the government's plan to have fewer but nimbler banks, they are sceptical about the benefits of merging two or more weak banks or a weak bank with a stronger bank that could strain the stronger entity. Former RBI deputy governor K. C. Chakravorty cautioned "" merging inefficient banks would not help create efficiency"". Bank employee unions have also opposed merger proposals over concerns they could lead to job losses. A million bank workers had observed a one- day strike on Tuesday opposing mergers. The idea to merge state- run banks has been around for some time, but gained momentum after a 2014 report by the PJ Nayak Committee asked the government to work towards reducing its liability to recapitalise banks in a cyclical fashion. It recommended either privatisation or consolidation as a way out. The government had in this year's budget announced that it would pump in Rs 10,000 crore into public sector banks in the current financial year to meet their capital requirements. During 2016- 17, the government had infused Rs 25,000 crore in state- run banks. However, the RBI estimates that the proposed cash infusion will be far short of the requirement and has given two scenarios to the government — one where the PSU lenders will face huge hair- cuts trying to resolve their asset woes and require a capital infusion of Rs 48,000 crore. The second where the banks fare better and would require a capital support of around Rs 30,000 crore. Besides merging larger banks with the smaller ones, the other alternative could be regional consolidation. "" This can be a parallel exercise… only mergers should not be done so as to make the merged entity weaker or to create a mismatch … careful vetting has to be done before thinking of merging one bank with another,"" the officials added.

"Over 120 residents of a highrise in Nalasopara (E) were rescued after smoke engulfed the building following a fire in a meter box on the third floor on Wednesday.The Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation fire brigade reached the 14-storey Reliable Prestige building at Chandan Naka around 2.15pm. According to fire officer Umesh Dhodi, people were trapped in the smoke up to the seventh and eighth floors. Fire personnel rescued around 25 people, including women and kids, using the turntable ladder. Another 100 people, residing on the upper floors, were rescued using a staircase and taken to the terrace. Though the cause of fire is under investigation, firemen said a short circuit could have caused it."
"Over four-anda-half years after the bourses suspended trading in the Deccan Chronicle Holdings (DCHL) scrip, the BSE on Wednesday delisted the beleaguered Hyderabad-based company against which insolvency proceedings have recently been initiated by Canara Bank for defaulting on loans. DCHL is one of the 55 companies to be delisted by BSE on Wednesday following a notice on `compulsory delisting of companies' issued by the bourse on August 21 to its members. The BSE had suspended trading in the DCHL scrip in Janua ry 2013 along with NSE. The BSE delisting comes after NSE had in April 2017 put DCHL on the list of companies to be delisted with effect from May 12, 2017. Elaborating on the consequences of compulsory delisting, the BSE said that according to the Sebi Delisting Regulations, 2009, the securities of these companies would cease to be listed and therefore not available for trading on the platform of the exchange. It also said that the promoters of these delisted companies would be required to purchase the shares (of the company) from the public shareholders as per the fair value determined by the independent valuer appointed by the exchange."

Actor Amitabh Bachchan at a presser to announce his game showRANBIR Kapoor is naturally looking to change his career graph — the talented actor is unfortunately known for many of his failed ventures rather than those that have done well. So, in a bid to experiment with more popular filmmakers, Kapoor has been having meetings with several of them. One among these is Luv Ranjan, the director of Pyaar Ka Punchnama. The two are planning to collaborate on a light-hearted romcom. Moreover, Ranbir has wanted to collaborate with Luv for a while now, and is likely to start work on this project by April 2018. If you ask us, hit or flop, we’ll watch this actor anywhere.ONLY a couple of weeks ago, the country’s khadi elite were treated to a delightful evening. The Congress was hosting the relaunch of a national newspaper that was first founded by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1938 as a tool to win Independence. Appropriately, the soiree was hosted at the Nehru Auditorium in New Delhi. Sonia Gandhi, a little frail but crisp in a handloom sari, was present, along with Rahul (freshly returned from Italy) and Priyanka. Several of the old guard and new liberals filled the room too. We spotted Ghulam Nabi Azad, Prithviraj Chauhan, Anand Sharma, Shobhna Bhartia, Mala Singh and her son Jaisal with his wife Anjali. Romi Chopra, the delightful flaneur who is also the driving force behind Sonia’s saris, was also there. Among the corporates, Rahul Bajaj was a reassuring presence, since several of the others are too afraid of being seen at a Congress party. It was notable that the party that not too long ago ruled the entire country, and now only an auditorium. However, the quiet class that filled the air, made the loud marketing ploys of other parties seem like too much noise.CURRENTLY, actor Naseeruddin Shah is amidst the rehearsals of a heart-wrenching play, The Father, that deals with age-related mental illness and opens next month at NCPA. Incidentally, it was fellow actor Paresh Rawal who introduced the thespian to Florian Zeller’s play. Despite having diametrically different political leanings — Rawal firmly on the right and Shah rooting for the secular card — they remain “great friends”. “His politics are his affairs and he probably has to toe the line. But, he is clever and he knows what he is doing,” says Shah. “I think Paresh has seen this German film called “Mephisto”. It’s about an actor who plays Mephistopheles’ role and is very affected, and gets drawn into a political party. I hope Paresh has seen it. He loves me very much and the feeling is mutual. I admire him as an actor.” Shah goes on to say, tongue tightly in cheek: “I hope he did more good movies, and not make so many outrageous statements.” But we want to know what the two discuss when they meet. “Movies, theatre and everything but politics,” he quips.ART connoisseur Sangita Jindal seems to be having a week of eating out (she hosted a private dinner last week for the Asia Society). Interestingly, this one was one of her pre-birthday celebrations, and hosted at a soon-to-be launched organic cafe at Kala Ghoda. A group of 15 of her closest girls were present, including daughter Tarini and sisin- law Kahini Kanoria. Others included Mukeeta Javeri, Anupa Mehta, Mamta Mangaldas, Soha Parikh, Abha Narain Lambah (who is now restoring the Jewish synagogue) and Vasudha Ruia. Of course the banter involved artists and their assorted projects, but since the restaurant is gluten-free and plant-based, healthy eating and weightloss stories were as ubiquitous as the avocado.A beefy actor is well on his way to being confirmed for the leading role in a hip film, made by an avant-garde director duo. But the filmmakers, who are known for their wild action sequences, want the hero to be bare-chested for some sequences. The actor has been asked to shed 20 kilos, which is no easy task. Of course the actor has agreed. But the filmmakers are now holding his contract and signing amount until the star has shed his weight. Last we heard, he called his sultry girlfriend and wanted to hit the gym with her.Consent is not enough. Insist on enthusiasm."
"Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi will meet with powerful Pakistani generals on Thursday to formulate a response to the new US policy on Afghanistan that includes greater pressure on Islamabad to do more to rein in militants.President Donald Trump has chastised Pakistan for harbouring ""agents of chaos"" and providing safe havens to militant groups waging an insurgency against a US-backed government in Kabul, saying Islamabad must promptly change tack.White House officials have gone further and threatened aid and military cuts, as well as other measures to force nuclear-armed Pakistan's hand and bring about an end to the 16-year-war.Abbasi has not responded yet to Trump's remarks but Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said Washington should not use Pakistan as a ""scapegoat"" for its failures in America's longest running war. Pakistan denies harbouring militants.As is often the case with Pakistan, the final decision about how to proceed rests with the military, which has ruled the country for nearly half its 70-year history. It calls the shots on key parts of Pakistan's foreign policy, including ties with the United States, Afghanistan and arch-foe India.Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, who will be part of the National Security Council meeting on Thursday, a day earlier met with US Ambassador David Hale and said Islamabad wanted trust and understanding rather than US aid money.Pakistani officials bristle at what they say is a lack of respect by Washington for the country's sacrifices in the war against militancy and its successes against groups like al Qaeda, Islamic State or the Pakistani Taliban.Pakistan estimates there have been 70,000 casualties in militant attacks since it joined the US ""war on terrorism"" after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.""We feel the American administration led by Mr Trump has been totally one sided, unfair to Pakistan and does not appreciate and recognise Pakistan has been a pivotal player...in the campaign against terrorism,"" Senator Mushahid Hussain, chairman of the senate defence committee, told Reuters on Thursday.Pakistani officials have also been angered by Trump imploring old rival India to play a greater role in reconstructing Afghanistan, warning a greater Indian role in Kabul could be a threat to regional peace.Pakistan fears New Delhi's greater influence in Afghanistan would leave it sandwiched by India, its bigger neighbour against whom it has fought three wars since independence in 1947.Analysts have also warned putting greater pressure on Pakistan risks driving Islamabad deeper into the arms of China, its northern neighbour which is investing nearly $60 billion in infrastructure projects as part of its Belt and Road initiative.China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, told US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call the United States must value Pakistan's role in Afghanistan and respect its security concerns, according to Chinese state media.""Things have changed since 9/11,"" added Hussain.""The US today has far more diminished clout and leverage in the region and we have far more strategic space and options in our foreign policy.""The relationship between the two countries has endured periods of extreme strain in recent years, especially after al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by US special forces in Pakistan in a 2011 raid."
"PALLEKELE :Sri Lanka are desperate to arrest their freefall as they grapple with transition and rank bad performances in this series. Even their past matchwinner, Lasith Malinga, has not been of much help. He didn’t take a wicket in the first ODI in Dambulla on Sunday as India swept to a ninewicket victory. Sri Lanka are in a dilemma as there is little experience in the pace department with Dhammika Prasad and Nuwan Pradeep injured and left-arm Vishwa Fernando having made his debut only on Sunday. Lasith Malinga, the only bowler in ODI history to take four wickets in a row, has largely plied his trade for Indian Premier League champions Mumbai Indians in the last few seasons. Criticised for poor fitness and not pushing himself for Sri Lanka, Malinga made his ODI return in the ICC Champions Trophy in June this year, having played his previous game back in November 2015. Malinga, who turns 34 on Monday, took just three wickets in three matches as Sri Lanka tumbled out in the group stage, despite beating eventual runners-up India. Malinga returned 0/52 in Dambulla, but Sri Lanka interim head coach, Nic Pothas described him a “leader” in the dressing room. “I don’t purely look at what Malinga can do with the ball. I also look at what he does for the young bowlers in the change room. Lasith is a very, very valuable player for us. “Yes, he hasn’t performed like the Lasith of a few years ago, but we could draw up a list of a whole host of players who are not performing like they were a few years ago.” Pothas pointed out the catches dropped off Malinga. In nine matches this year, he has taken just seven wickets, but 12 catches have been put down off his bowling. He completed 200 ODIs in Dambulla and is two short of claiming 300 scalps."
"Panchkula: With lakhs of Dera Sacha Sauda followers swarming into Panchkula ahead of the verdict in the sexual exploitation case registered against its chief, Gurmeet Ram Rahim, the states of Haryana and Punjab have been put on a high alert. A Special Central Bureau Investigation (CBI) court will declare the verdict on August 25.Rahim has been accused of sexually exploiting Dera’s sadhvis (female followers) and faces charges under Sections 376 (rape), 509, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The Dera chief, who has been attending the court proceedings through video conferencing from Sirsa, has been summoned in the court on August 25.All schools and colleges in Chandigarh and Panchkula have been shut for at least two days ahead of the verdict and there will also be a clampdown on buses plying to Haryana and Chandigarh for the next two days.As many as 75 companies of central forces remain deployed in various districts of Punjab, which has a large number of Dera followers, especially in districts bordering Haryana. All Punjab Roadways buses plying via Haryana have stopped service till further orders.  In order to avert a 2014-like situation, when another sect head from Hisar, Rampal had defied the court order and the police were locked in a 10-day standoff with his followers, the Haryana Police have virtually sealed the roads leading to the special CBI Court. “We have eight additional companies of paramilitary forces and an additional force of 2,500 police personnel has been mobilised for deployment. Nearly 2,000 homeguards have been called in to manage crowds,” Haryana Additional Chief Secretary Ram Niwas said.“The decision to appear before the court is the responsibility of the Dera chief. He has to take a call on this. We will call in the Army, if necessary, and even impose curfew, according to the circumstances.” Meanwhile, Punjab Police have alerted its zonal officers following inputs that Dera followers have stored petrol and diesel in drums at Naam Charcha Ghar in Faridkot and other districts."
"Par Gerell likes the Boss, not so much the bosses. The Swedish table tennis player, a fan of Bruce Springsteen, is sceptical about the changes in the sport made, or proposed, by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF). The 3 5 -yea rold G erel l was a mem ber of the Falcons TTC squad that won the inaug ural U ltimate Table Tennis league in Mumbai recently. When asked what he thought of the ITTF's proposal -tabled at its AGM in May -to try out racquets in non-wood materials, Gerell said, “They made some strange changes before, so I am not very positive about this idea. When you make a change, you really need to think about it. The ITTF does not always think about it.“ The reason for the ITTF's racquet experiment is money and a “spirit of innovation“.Currently, the rule is that 85 per cent of a racquet has to be wooden. However, wood racquets are expensive. Sports like tennis, badminton and squash long ago embraced alternative materials for their equipment. In 2014, the ITTF made a major change in a fundamental piece of the opera ­ the ball.Out went the fast, traditional celluloid ball.In came a slower plastic ball. This was done to lengthen rallies and make the game more appealing. While the intention was noble, the execution was problematic. And that is partly why Gerell does not have confidence in the ITTF's measures. Since the switch from celluloid to plastic, the ITTF's 93 approved manu facturers made balls that were very different from each other. Players adjusted to one brand one week, but had to re adju st to another the next. It was frust rating. “ The new balls had no quality at all,“ Gerell said. The ball is in the ITTF's court now. And so is the racquet."
"PATNA: Family members of two minor flood victims were forced to carry the bodies on their shoulders in north Bihar’s Muzaffarpur after being allegedly denied an ambulance or a mortuary van. Raju Mahto and Sanjay Paswan carried the bodies of children of their families 250 metres from the post-mortem department of Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, 71km north of Patna, before hiring private vehicles to take the bodies to their villages in Meenapur block of the district. Abhishek Kumar, son of Raju Mahto of Dubarbana village, and Bunty, nephew of Sanjay Paswan of Mothaha village, died after drowning in flood waters on Tuesday. Officers from Meenapur police station had taken the bodies to SKMCH for autopsy. “We pleaded with the hospital administration to provide us an ambulance or a mortuary van to carry the bodies to our respective villages. When they refused, we were left with no option, but to carry the bodies on our shoulders to the place where private transporters park their vehicles,” Mahto and Paswan said. SKMCH superintendent Dr GK Thakur, however, refuted the allegation. “We have always provided ambulances and mortuary vans whenever required. Bodies of Abhishek and Bunty were directly handed over to their relativesafterpost-mortemexamination, and they never requested for vehicles,” Thakur claimed. Thakur said he had ordered an inquiry into the matter. A team of doctors and hospital officials are probing it. “Stern action will be taken, if any hospital employee is found guilty,” Thakur added. District magistrate Dharmendra Singh could not be reached for comments as he was busy with the flood relief operations. THIRUVANANTHAPURAM : The Kerala high court on Wednesday rejected a petition filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) challenging a special court’s order acquitting Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the 20-year-old SNC Lavalin scam case. The court came down heavily on the CBI while clearing the chief minister, saying Pinarayi was made a scapegoat by the premier investigating agency. The verdict gives enough credence to opposition parties’ charge that the CBI is often used by the Centre to settle political scores with opponents. The court said Pinarayi cannot be made accountable for loss to the exchequer and there is no evidence to prove he made financial gains from the deal. It, however, said three senior officials of the state electricity board discharged by a special court will have to face the trial. The case relates to the awarding of a contract to the Canadian power giant SNC Lavalin to renovate three hydroelectric projects, a deal in which the state allegedly lost ₹374 crore. The CBI alleged when Pinarayi was the power minister in 1996, he, along with the other accused, hatched a criminal conspiracy to award a supply contract to SNC-Lavalin at an exorbitant cost.. “I am happy truth has finally prevailed. There were many attempts to tarnish me and my party citing the case,” CM said. In 2013, a special court exonerated him in the case that was later challenged by the CBI in the high court. The case was handed over to the CBI in 2005 by then chief minister Oommen Chandy."
"People gather at the scene where police are investigating a van with Spanish licence plates containing gas canisters which was found near a Rotterdam venue where a rock concert was cancelled. (Source: Reuters) People gather at the scene where police are investigating a van with Spanish licence plates containing gas canisters which was found near a Rotterdam venue where a rock concert was cancelled. (Source: Reuters)

Dutch police on Thursday questioned a Spanish man detained with gas canisters in a van while driving near a concert venue where a rock concert was cancelled due to a threat of an attack. The man was being held in Rotterdam, where he was stopped in the white vehicle with Spanish licence plates on Wednesday, police said.

Spanish police had tipped the Dutch to potential danger at the venue known as Maassilo where California band Allah-Las was set to play, but a judicial source in Spain told Reuters there was no link to the attacks in Spain last week. “The investigation is ongoing and we are questioning the man,” police spokesman Gijs van Nimwegen said.

“We are working to determine his identity.” The van contained “a couple” of gas canisters and the man’s driving had been “conspicuous” he said, declining to comment on Spanish police reports he had been drinking alcohol.

The Spanish source said late Wednesday that the tip resulted from an investigation by the Spanish Civil Guard that had been under way for some time and had no direct relation to the two vehicle attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils in Catalonia that killed 15 people.

Rotterdam Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told a news conference late Wednesday it was also not clear whether the threat tip and the detection of the van were connected. He warned against “swift conclusions” while noting the white van had Spanish licence plates and had been flagged for circling near the concert venue.

“It would be wrong at this moment to pile up these facts and conclude … there was a plan to attack with gas bottles,” Aboutaleb said. Spanish news agency Europa Press, quoting Spanish anti-terrorist force sources, reported that the Spaniard arrested in Rotterdam had, in principle, no link to jihadist terrorism. The gas canisters in his vehicle were apparently for domestic use, it said.

Police said the concert was cancelled at around 7 pm, shortly before doors were to be opened for guests. No one was hurt and only one suspect was in custody, Dutch police said.

The National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism’s office said the threat level in the Netherlands was unchanged at “substantial”, where it has been since 2013.

"People must be stopped from dumping “ritualistic material” into the Ganga, considered a holy river by millions of Indians, says a study by a central government institute.. The study by reseachers at the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has called for restrictions on cremation-related activity, disposal of dumps and immersion of Hindu idols, garlands and flowers in the river.. The study also held that a large number of “medicinal herbs growing in sub-alpine and alpine region near Gomukh (the origin of the Ganga), Chidbasa, Gangotri and adjoining areas (of the Himalayas) must be protected” to protect the “medicinal water quality” of the river. It called for changing pesticides-based farming along a 540-km stretch in Uttar Pradesh to organic farming.. The study is a preliminary attempt to understand the anti-microbial characteristics of river Ganga. It said the “disposal of ritualistic material must be prevented from entering” the river Ganga to keep it clean.. The study said that although the Ganga finds its own way to survive despite unrelenting disposal of waste, immediate attention was needed to protect it and its special properties.. The study, ‘Assessment of water quality and sediment to understand the special properties of River Ganga’, was conducted after the Union minister for water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenaion Uma Bharati last year said that NEERI will conduct a study to evaluate the medicinal values, if any, of the Ganga.. The NEERI study was submitted to the National Mission for Clean Ganga, the nodal authority for the Ganga’s protection and conservation, a few months ago but is yet to be made public.. The study also stressed the need for decentralized sewage treatment plants (STPs), individual household latrines (IHHLs) with proper excreta management in villages along the river, adoption of stringent measures like zero-liquid discharge by industries, and ensuring minimum environment flow (e-flow) in rivers.. It also called for strict monitoring of wastewater from major multi-speciality hospitals, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries situated in Kanpur, Bhagalpur, Allahabad and Varanasi and suggested mitigation measures as per the latest bio-medical waste management rules 2016.. It noted that farming is common along the riverbank from Harsil (Uttarakhand) to Gangasagar (West Bengal) but that the use of “pesticides in agriculture in the surrounding areas increases rapidly as the river flow through the plains”.. “Converting from pesticidebased agriculture to organic farming must be initially considered in the stretch between Narora and Allahabad due to extensive farming activities and reduced flow in river,” the study said.. Cleaning up the Ganga has been a priority project for Indian governments for nearly three decades but despite spending thousands of crores of rupees the mission has failed.. In a scathing judgment, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in July 2017 noted that “even after spending Rs7,304.64 crore up to March 2017 by the central government, state government and local authorities of the state of UP” the status of the Ganga has “not improved in terms of quality or otherwise and it continues to be a serious environmental issue”.. The NGT in a 543-page judgment had also banned all construction within 100 metres of the river’s edge from Haridwar in Uttarakhand to Unnao in Uttar Pradesh."
"Planning to move to a property in the interior parts of the city that promises to have abundant groundwater?Check the quality of water before deciding, as some of these neighbourhoods are reporting saline water ingress. The development came as a revelation for hydrogeologists, who were informed by residents trying to tap into deeper acquifers. Hydrogeologists are alarmed since these areas have never recorded salinity in the past. Areas like Nungambakkam, Aminjikarai, Ashok Nagar and Rangarajapuram in Kodambakkam are now getting saline water from deeper borewells. These areas are ro ughly 10km from the sea. President of the Federation of Kodambakkam and Mambalam Residents Associations R Govindaraj said, “We have seen groundwater changing colour earlier. But, this is the first time residents are reporting salinity as they dig deeper, after water levels drop ped this year.“ Another resident of the locality, who drilled a borewell, said he was getting saline water at about 190ft. Hydrogeologist J Saravanan said salinity levels in groundwater are shocking as it was more than twice that of permissible drinking water standards. “This is an alarming situation because usually greater depth means good water. Now, we are tapping the deepest aquifers and the quality is poor,“ he said, adding that pockets in Aminjikarai and Nungambakkam were getting salty water as borewells drilled deeper recently . “But, we do not know whether this is due to so me sort of intrusion or overextraction. While the only reason is saline ingress, it needs to be established whether any intrusion has taken place,“ he said. Against the demand of more than 1,200MLD, Metrowater is now only supplying 420MLD to 450MLD and the rest is from groundwater. Environmentalist Jayashree Venkatesan said rampant extraction of aquifers will lead to salt water intrusion. “Salinity is not surprising because we are overextracting our freshwater aquifers,“ she said. The best way to tackle this is through rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling, says Saravanan."

"POTHAS EVEN BLAMED THE MEDIA FOR PUTTING A “SPIN” TO HIS PREVIOUS STATEMENT AND THAT HE HAD NO ISSUES WITH THE SRI LANKAN BOARD. PALLEKELE: Sri Lankan cricket, in crisis with the national team plunging from one low to another, scrambled on Wednesday to limit the public relations disaster that followed the defeat in the first ODI in Dambulla on Sunday. Team’s interim coach, Nic Pothas had blasted the current set-up following the nine-wicket defeat at Dambulla saying “too many cooks” were responsible for the current plight of the national team, which was also routed 3-0 in the Test series. However, on Wednesday, Sri Lanka Cricket took the drastic step of asking Pothas to issue a statement at the press conference ahead of the second ODI to be played here on Thursday. Pothas this time said everything was fine with the team set-up and the processes put in place would pull Sri Lanka out of the rut. He even blamed the media for putting a “spin” to his previous statement and that he had no issues with the Sri Lankan cricket board. His comments were in contrast to those made on Sunday. He had said the players suffered because there were too many people meddling in selection and decision-making. Stalwarts of the 1996 World Cup triumph, Sanath Jayasuriya (chief selector) and Asanka Gurusinha (cricket manager), play influential roles. “We will start off with a statement from the coach, and then a statement from the captain before we go to the Q& A,” announced Vrai Raymond, SLC’s media head. “We would like to limit it to tomorrow’s match and nothing else.” With ODI skipper, Upul Tharanga, seated beside him, Pothas said: “We are in good shape at the moment. The boys are in very good spirits. As I mentioned before, we are focused on the processes and procedures which will stand us in good stead in the future. That future will take time as we have stated before.” FEAR OF FAILURE, SAYS JAYAWARDENE Mahela Jayawardene feels the fear of failure is impeding the growth of the Sri Lankan team. “I feel the team’s confidence is low.

Pallekele: Former batsman Mahela Jayawardene feels the fear of failure is impeding the growth of the Sri Lankan cricket team, which is currently being outplayed by India in an ongoing series.

Sri Lanka's heavy loss to India in the three-match Test series came after the island nation lost the five-match ODI series against minnows Zimbabwe 2-3.

""I feel the team's confidence is low. The fear of failure factor has come out. They don't look confident; they don't look hungry enough in the middle. They need to address that and find solutions very quickly,"" Jayawardene told ESPNcricinfo.

Talking about the whitewash against India, Jayawardene said the team failed in all departments.

""I am sure the guys would be very disappointed with their performance in the Test series. It was a great challenge for them to test themselves against the number one team.

""They didn't handle certain situations well. First innings batting too let them down when there were no demon in the wickets. They also never looked like getting 20 wickets,"" said the former Sri Lankan captain.

Jayawardene, however, was all praise for India captain Virat Kohli, who guided his team to an eighth consecutive Test series win.

""Look he is a proactive captain. He is very aggressive. He has a brilliant record to start with, though most of the games were played din India, you still have to win matches.

""He has led the team from the front so the rest of the boys are following on and off the field. The Test for them now will be playing away from home.

""They have created a good nucleus of players who are taking responsibility. There is good competition for batting and bowling positions,"" he said.

The Sri Lanka great was all praise for Hardik Pandya too.

""He is an amazing talent, especially for the shorter formats of the game. To have someone who can bowl between 130 -140kmph is a great addition to the side.

""You saw his batting skills as well. He has the temperament to go big when he needs to. At the same time, he can bat for time. It gives India a lot of options.""

His value is no less as a fast bowler, said Jayawardene.

""He has given India the combination they were craving for. To have five bowlers with three quicks and two spinners. It lends a nice balance to the side,"" he added."

"President Donald Trump said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is beginning to respect the US, the latest comments that suggest his administration is moving closer to seeking talks over Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal. “I respect the fact that I believe he is starting to respect us,“ Trump said of Kim at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona on Tuesday evening. “Maybe, probably not, something positive will come out of it.“ Secret a r y of St ate Rex Tillerson went out of his way earlier on Tuesday to note that North Korea hadn't carried out “provocative acts“ since the UN Security Council imposed new sanctions on the country. “I am pleased to see that the regime in Pyongyang has cert ai n ly demonst rated some level of restraint that we have not seen in the past,“ Tillerson told repor ters at t he St ate Department. “Perhaps we are seeing our pathway to sometime in the near future having some dialogue.“ The comments by Tillerson, the top US diplomat, were far more conciliatory than previous warnings from Trump."

"President threatened Tuesday to bring the US government to the brink of a if needed to pressure Congress into funding the border wall that was a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign.

Delivering a warning to Democratic lawmakers who have objected to his plans to construct a wall along the US-Mexico frontier, Trump called them “obstructionists” and said that it was time for the US to crack down on illegal immigration.

""If we have to close down our government, we’re building that wall,” Trump told thousands of supporters gathered in Phoenix for a campaign-style rally. “One way or the other, we’re going to get that wall.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.3 per cent, the S&P 500 dropped 0.25 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.32 per cent. The benchmark S&P also fell below its 50-day moving average again on Wednesday, a key level it has struggled to maintain since falling below on August 10.

Credit ratings agency Fitch said on Wednesday that if the debt ceiling is not raised in a timely manner, it would review the US sovereign debt rating, which is its measure of confidence in the soundness of the US economy.

The president also said he might terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement at some point. “His comments on the negotiations once again brings the general direction toward obstructing free trade, and raises concerns over its impact on global trade,” said Hideyuki Ishiguro, a senior strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.

Trump has asked for $1.6 billion to begin construction of the wall, with Congress under pressure to pass some kind of spending bill to keep the government open after September 30."
"President Trump issued an extraordinary challenge to his own party late Tuesday , threatening to shut down the government in a matter of weeks if Congress did not fund a wall on the Mexican border -a signature pro mise of his election campaign. Trump followed up on that threat on Wednesday on Twitter by going after a key Republican senator, Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has been skeptical of the idea of the wall. “Phoenix crowd last night was amazing a packed house. I love the Great State of Arizona. Not a fan of Jeff Flake, weak on crime & border!“ tweeted Trump. On Tuesday night, he told a rowdy crowd in Phoenix, “If we have to close down our government, we're building that wall. We're going to have our wall.“ He added, “The American people voted for immigration control. We're going to get that wall.“ He also said that he would “probably end up terminating Nafta“. Nafta is a trade agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico. At the same rally , Trump also mounted an aggressive defense of his response to a deadly far-right march in Virginia, using a rally speech to condemn “dishonest“ media coverage of his widely criticised remarks. Trump faced bipartisan outrage after blaming “many sides“ for violence at the rally in Charlottesville, in which one anti-fascist protester was killed. Re-reading his statements that followed the clashes, he railed at reporters at the rally in Phoenix, Arizona, for misrepresenting his remarks -but omitted the equivocation that had sparked the backlash in the first place.“The very dishonest media...and I mean truly dishonest people in the media and the fake media, they make up stories. They don't report the facts.Just like they don't want to report that I spoke out forcefully against hatred, bigotry and violence and strongly condemned the neo-Nazis, the white supremacists and the KKK.“"

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked all wings of the government to work in a synchronised manner and pressed the bureaucracy to take speedy decisions, promising that honest decision-making with good intention would always be encouraged. Good governance should be a priority for the officers, he said during an interaction with a group of over 70 Additional Secretaries and Joint Secretaries in the central government, according to a PMO statement.  Modi asked the officers to focus attention on the 100 most backward districts of India, so that they can be brought up to the national average level, on various development parameters.  The prime minister said the combination of development and good governance is essential for the welfare and satisfaction of citizens, the statement said about the interaction that took place last evening.  He emphasised the need for all wings of the government to work in harmony and synchronisation to achieve the best possible results, it added.  Underlining the importance of breaking silos, he pressed for efficient internal communication between various departments of the government.  Modi said all officers must keep the poor and the ordinary citizens in their minds while taking decisions, the PMO said.  The prime minister said this was a unique opportunity for the officers to deliver their utmost for the benefit of the nation.  @media only screen and (min-width:0) and (max-width:1024px){ #div-gpt-ad-1494579592958-0{ display: none} }   googletag.cmd.push(function () { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1494579592958-0'); });   He underlined the necessity of speed and efficiency in decision-making and said that ?honest decision-making with good intention would always be encouraged by the union government, the statement said.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants a well-functioning railways that will help define a significant part of the story about his government and a short list of “experienced“ administrators is being considered in case Suresh Prabhu, who offered to resign on Wednesday , is replaced. But the PM also recognizes that Prabhu has put in a lot of effort on the aspect of improved connectivity.However, the narrative over the last few days that shifted to safety has raised concerns at the highest levels, senior officials familiar with the matter told ET. They said two senior leaders, a central minister and a major state leader, could be considered but no final decision has happened as yet. “He would prefer a dedicated minister to look at reform. Someone who has proved his mettle, is sincere and focussed on the ministry full-time. The PM is aware it is the ministry with the largest people connect and wants it to bear the stamp of his government's work with high-speed corridors, safe trains and smart stations,“ a senior official said. But more than anything, the PM wants trains to be safe for passengers, the official said. “The PM's modernisation plan can be put in place only by someone who understands business and administration. He would not want any controversies, especially with investment plans related to the bullet train speeding up.“ A minister high on integrity and focussed on delivery is what the PM wants, officials said. For the past two years the Centre and the ministry managed to make highlevel appointments in railways without any complaints of lobbying or bribery . This must also continue under any new minister, officials said.In a series of tweets posted after meeting the PM, Prabhu wrote: “Met PM... I am taking full moral responsibility. PM has asked me to wait.“ Two major rail accidents in last four days prompted Prabhu to offer his resignation. On Wednesday early morning, there was a major train derailment when nine coaches of Kaifiyat Express derailed near Auraiya, leaving over 70 injured.Prabhu also tweeted that he did everything possible to bring Indian Railways back on track. “In less than three years as minister, I have devoted my blood and sweat for the betterment of the Railways.

"Qatar has approved a law limiting domestic staff to a maximum of 10 hours work a day, the first such protection for thousands of household maids, nannies and cooks in the emirate. The Domestic Employment Law also orders employers to pay staff wages at the end of each month and entitles workers to at least one day off per week and an annual leave of three weeks, the Qatar News Agency reported. They will also receive end-ofservice benefits equating to a minimum of three weeks wages for each year of service when their contract ends. The law prohibits staff being recruited from abroad who are older than 60 and younger than 18. The legislation was issued on Tuesday by Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, QNA reported. Although Qatar has come under severe international pressure to improve its record on the treatment of construction workers in the run-up to the 2022 World Cup, until now domestic staff have not been protected by any legislation. Critics have long campaigned for legal protection for domestic staff, with some claiming they are subjected to working in slave-like conditions. These included physical and sexual abuse, wages not being paid and passports being confiscated."
"Railway minister Suresh Prabhu offered to quit on Wednesday following two train accidents in five days. PM Narendra Modi's pointed response that he should wait -while not rejecting the resignation -set off intense speculation over a Cabinet reshuffle that could be a major exercise ahead of the 2019 polls. The train accident at Khatauli in western UP on August 19 that killed 23 people was followed by revelations of appalling negligence by railway staff. On Wednesday , 74 people were injured when 12 coaches of the Azamgarh-Delhi Kaifiyat Express derailed in UP's Auraiya district after hitting a dumper.The two accidents have already claimed one high-profile scalp -railway board chairman AK Mittal stepped down following a nudge from the government.He has been replaced with Ashwani Lohani, chairman and managing director of Air India, who is originally from the Indian Railway Mechanical Engineering department. “I met the prime minister taking full moral responsibility. PM has asked me to wait,“ Prabhu tweeted. Significantly, he disclosed that the PM did not turn down his offer straightaway. Modi's advice to wait takes on significance as Prabhu was inducted in the government when he was not even a member of BJP, let alone Parliament, and was given the charge of railways -a priority area for the PM who cherishes his links with the railways which go back to the days when he hawked tea on the platform. The PM's cyptic response was grist for simmering speculation about a shakeup of the Union cabinet being round the corner to fill up crucial vacancies, punish non-performers and reward allies, both new ones as well as potential ones like AIADMK. The two accidents provided a fresh handle to the opposition which was already gunning for Prabhu. Though the number of accidents during Prabhu's tenure declined, mishaps at regular intervals attracted the charge that he was not able to enforce accountability in railway brass and its feuding branches. In a series of emotional tweets, Prabhu said he was “extremely pained“ by the two derailments in Uttar Pradesh. “In less than three years as minister, I have devoted my blood and sweat for the betterment of the railways. Under the leadership of the PM, I tried to overcome decades of neglect through systemic reforms in all areas leading to unprecedented investment and milestones,“ he said. If Prabhu goes, this would be the sec ond time he would have quit as minister. He had to go as power minister in the Vajpayee government because the Shiv Sena leadership wanted him to be replaced with a more “pragmatic“ person. In railways, Prabhu did a lot in terms of managing long-term finance, focusing on hygiene and passenger amenities and preparing a blueprint for upgrade of platforms and stations. Prabhu, sources said, could not handle the stubborn railway bureaucracy and get a fix on festering issues like the feuding between electric and loco units. He viewed his role as a minister as only to frame broader policies and managing finances for the transporter and delegated all administrative pow ers to the railway board and zonal railways.But Prabhu was seen by the railway bureaucracy as someone who wanted to abdicate responsibility by not engaging himself in the rough and tumble of running trains."

Asked for his reaction to the indication by Prabhu that he had offered to quit taking moral responsibility for train accidents at a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Jaitley told reporters that the prime minister will take a decision “on whatever request the railway minister has made“.

"Railway minister Suresh Prabhu's offer to resign -after two rail accidents in four days -was not accepted on Wednesday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but a new incumbent in the Rail Bhavan is now a possibility in the cabinet reshuffle that's widely expected in the next few days.The broad line of government thinking is that the ability to deliver, especially the last mile, for big welfare schemes and not caste or other political considerations will determine the choice of appointees.Two people familiar with the matter told ET that in case of a change in railways, a senior minister with economic governance credentials or a major BJP state leader may get the job. FM Arun Jaitley , when asked about Prabhu's offer to resign at a press briefing after the Cabinet meeting, said the PM will take a call.Senior officials told ET the government hadn't expected Prabhu to tweet about his meeting with the PM and his offer to resign.Agriculture is another ministry that's been discussed in the context of a reshuffle. Other areas of recent focus have been skill development and encouraging entrepreneurship. Ministries such as environment are being run by ministers with additional charge, and new appointees are likely.This reshuffle, two years before the 2019 general elections, is crucial because any new appointee will still have time to deliver before polls. It's very unlikely that the composition of the Cabinet Committee on Security will change. The committee comprises, apart from the PM, the ministers of finance, home, external affairs and defence. The PM leaves for China and Myanmar on September 3, and any reshuffle is likely before that.Political considerations will apply only to the extent of accommodating BJP's new ally JD(U), which has formally joined, and the ruling party's considerations of some state-level representation. More representation UP and MP may happen. Two ministers, one cabinet and one junior, may be brought in from JD(U)."
"Rain followed Anjaniputra team to Scotland as well. The film team had earlier faced disruption due to rains when it was shooting in Karnataka. To their surprise, they faced raines in Scotland too where two songs for the film were shot with lead actors Puneeth Rajkumar and Rashmika Mandanna.





“It was unbelievable but true. We faced rain in all the places we shot here. And when we went to Scotland, the problem was the same. We did not expect rains there. But in the end it was a pleasant shooting experience. It is a beautiful place and the shooting went well,” director Harsha said.



Harsha is, however, recovering from a sore throat he managed to acquire in Scotland. “I have temporarily lost my voice. I do not know why it happened,” he says.



Meanwhile, Puneeth Rajkumar found Scotland too pleasing and extended his stay there after shooting for the film there. While the rest of the Anjaniputra team returned to India earlier this week, Puneeth continued his stay and turned it into a personal holiday for himself and his family."
"RAIPUR: BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh’s official body for bovine welfare has a recommended buying cow urine from cattle owners to discourage the people from abandoning their livestock. Visheshar Patel, the chairman of the state’s Gau Sewa Ayog, told Hindustan Times , on Tuesday that the urine can be used for research to develop different products including fertilisers and pesticides. Patel’s comments came days after nearly 200 cows were found dead in three shelters run by a BJP leader, sparking criticism of the Raman Singh government which has made cow protection part of its official agenda. “We have sent this proposal and we believe that cow urine should be purchased by the government at ~10 per litre. If this project starts, the people of the state who are abandoning the cows will keep them home for monetary benefits,” Patel added. “Dus nahi..paanch ya saat rupaye bhi per litre ho jayega to kisan gaayo ko ghar mein rakhenge...raste mein nahi chhodenge (Even if the people get ~5-7, the people will not abandon their cows),” he added. Many people abandon their cows after the animals stop giving milk or turn infirm due to old age, often leading to bovine deaths due to hunger and illness. The cow commission has estimated Chhattisgarh’s cow population to be 92 lakh bovines. It also runs 115 cowsheds in different parts of the state. He said, cow urine will be used to make “pesticide (jaivik keetniyantrak) and fertiliser (jeevamirt khaad)” besides “amritpaani”, which he described as a miracle solution that could revitalise barren land. BJP leaders and other groups affiliated to the party have been making many claims about medicinal and other benefits of cow urine, which experts say are not scientifically proven."
"Rajkummar Rao was never the quintessential Bollywood hero, but he is a force to reckon with, winning viewer appreciation, awards, and box office success. But for all his talent, the path to the centre-stage was once blocked by the barb wire of rejection. “Going back four or five years, I can definitely recall a couple of incidents where people told me, ‘We can’t cast you for the lead role; we’d rather take you for some other part.’ I think that’s because they all try and play safe and be secure, because the [financial] risk is really big when it comes to filmmaking,” says Rajkummar. In seven years in Bollywood, he was part of an ensemble cast in Kai Po Che (2013); carried an arthouse film, Shahid (2013), as the solo lead, with a perfor mance that won him a National Film Award; had strong supporting roles in the big hit Queen (2014) and the critically acclaimed Aligarh (2014); and plays a quirky romantic character in this year’s Bareilly Ki Barfi. The 32-year-old says he’s Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s film Padmavati might miss its release date of November 11. According to Mid Day, the film’s shoot is facing problems due to the ongoing Federation of Western India Cine Employees strike. The film team faces a technician shortage. Forbes list of highest paid actors, and Indian actors Shah Rukh Khan ($38 million), Salman Khan ($37 million) and Akshay Kumar ($35.5 million) have made it to the list at the 8th, 9th and 10th position respectively. Actor Aamir Khan is not in the list, despite his mega-hit Dangal. films in the Conjuring film franchise. “We had no pressure on us as such, to make it as popular as the first Conjuring film,” says Sigman. “It was a really good story, and the character I’m playing was pretty challenging. I hope that people are able to watch the film without any biases.” Stephanie also reveals that she is good friends with actor Bárbara Mori, and loved her in the Bollywood film Kites, co-starring Hrithik Roshan. “I know a lot about Bollywood,” she says, “thanks to Bárbara, who is like my best friend. I absolutely love [Kites], and I’ve become a big fan of Hrithik Roshan as well.” glad things have changed. “It’s a pretty different scenario that we see in [Bollywood] today. Audiences want to see more mainstream actors playing characters first, no matter [if it is] the lead or a supporting role. That outlook has brought about a lot of change,” says Rajkummar, giving credit for this transfor mation to the newer bunch of filmmakers and writers. “They’re penning amazing stories. They don’t write a script thinking if [certain] actors will do a [certain] part or not. That’s why we see even superstars playing characters,” he adds. Fellow actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui had said that racial bias in Bollywood led to filmmakers not casting top female actors against some male actors. Rajkummar quips that he himself has worked with “some really pretty girls — be it Kangana Ranaut, Sonam Kapoor, Shruti Haasan or Vidya Balan”, but adds, “I can understand where Nawaz is coming from”. He further says, “I don’t think [Nawaz] has anything to worry about, because his talent is bigger than anything.” The so-called ‘child abuse’ video, which has gone viral after stinging comments on it by top cricketers, most notably Virat Kohli, shows a little girl who tur ns out to be the niece of Bollywood singers Toshi and Sharib Sabri. Reacting to the vitriolic criticism being directed online at the child’s mother, Toshi Sabri says that a 90-second video is no basis for judging his sister’s parenting skills. About the child, a three-yearold named Haya, he says, “Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan don’t know about us. Hamare bachche ke bare mein humein pata hai naah ki hamara bachcha kaisa hai!” Toshi says that Haya would run off to play a minute after being scolded, and usually had to be pushed a bit to study. Haya’s mom made the video for her family’s WhatsApp group. She hadn’t expected this online attention. Virat’s comment on Instagram blamed the parent (not seen in the video) for ignoring “the pain and anger of the child” and alleged that “compassion has totally gone out of the window”. He also wrote: “A child can never lear n if intimidated.” This post got millions of views. Yuvraj Singh, Robin Uthappa, and Shikhar Dhawan added their FILMMAKER voice to Kohli’s criticism. Toshi responds that it’s okay for a parent to overlook the tantrums of the child if it’s for the sake of education. “Woh jo rona hota hain, woh uss moment ke liye tha, taaki usski maa usse padaaye na aur"

"Released on bail, LtCol Prasad Purohit said his discipline as an army man helped him cope with his almost nine year incarceration since 2008 in the Malegaon blast case. He would exercise, read, write in a diary and be a recluse behind bars. “I followed a strict regime. One hour morning walk later I would do weight training for 90 minutes. I have an implant in my right knee following an accident--while posted in a sensitive area.“ He didn't mention the posting, but it was in J&K. He was allowed to do strength training in jail on medical grounds He said a lot of reading and writing was also what kept him focused. “I had four sessions of reading. The first in the morning would be my professional reading from military press. He read about attack in desert mountains. Sectional leading Platoon tactics among other topics. The second would be lighter reading.Of nature, Ornithology , about jungle and wildlife. `' He said he was a keen ornithophile. “ Astro physics and books by Stephen Hawking,'' were what he enjoyed and read too. The third session later in the day would be biographies of military leaders like Kariappa and the one he was reading presently was one on General Slim, a decorated British Commander , and books on Philosophy .“At night I would delve into PG Wodehouse and PL Deshpande,'' he smiled, adding he had the whole Wodehouse collection.Evelyn Waugh's praise of Wodehouse in 1961had said, “...He will continue to release future generations from captivity that may be more irksome than our own. He has made a world for us to live in and delight in.“ in 2014 New Yorker wrote how Wodehouse was an “anodyne to annoyances.“ It was true for Purohit in his prison cell. He continued his “habit'' of maintaining and writing in a diary regularly . “In jail I kept to myself.'' Taloja prison is where three 1993 bomb blast accused includ ing Abu Salem are also housed.He was in a medical barrack because of his knee and medical condition of insomnia, he said.He would find time in the evenings to do “riyaaz, sans the tanpura''. “I've trained in classical music.'' He never had his two sons visit him in jail. They would visit him in court. Provided armed security to Purohit as there is a threat to his life, says Army The Army on Wednesday said it provided an armed escort to Lt-Colonel Shrikant Prasad Purohit to take him to the Colaba military station after his release from Taloja jail in Mumbai because of “a perceived threat to his security and life“. “It's is a sensitive case. We have to keep Purohit's security in mind. He reported back to the Mumbai detachment of the Pune-based Southern Command's Military Intelligence Liaison Unit, where he was serving earlier, after his release from the jail on bail,“ said a senior officer at the Army headquarters in New Delhi. “He continues to be on the supernumerary strength of the Military Intelligence unit till further orders. Certain restrictions will be placed on him in accordance with the Supreme Court order and Army's regulations,“ he added. The “suspended“ officer will also continue to be under the DV (discipline and vigilance) ban imposed on him after he was arrested in the Malegaon blasts case of September 2008. Under the DV ban, Purohit will not be eligible for any promotion or service course till the trial court delivers its final verdict in the case. He may be tasked with some administrative work during his suspension, said officials. TNN"
"Reliance Industries is bracing for an initial demand-supply mismatch, senior executives at the company with knowledge of the matter said, as it starts pre-booking of its much-anticipated 4G featurephone from August 24 evening, with an initial deposit of Rs 500 apiece.The Mukesh Ambani-owned company is training hundreds of sales people, its own and those from large-format retail chains such as The Mobile Store and Sangeetha Mobiles, for educating consumers on booking the JioPhone. “Our sales people will begin taking pre-bookings of the JioPhone for Rs 500 and will begin giving the phones when they arrive in September for an additional Rs 1,000,“ said Subhash Chandra, the managing director of Sangeetha Mobiles.Reliance Industries plans to gradually ramp up supply and aims to eventually have 5 million of the JioPhone available on retail channels every week. The mass market 4G phone being offered effectively free -the company though takes a three-year, interest-free refundable deposit of Rs 1,500 -is key to the new telecom operator Reliance Jio's bid to quickly scale up its nearly 125 million user base by targeting the 500 million featurephone users. Jio has been messaging its customers about the JioPhone and how to do the pre-booking. Retail chains on their own have also begun informing customers about the availability of the device, said another executive aware of the details of the plans. “Customers who expressed interest have just started getting SMS which states: `India ka Smartphone is finally here! Prebooking for JioPhone starts tomorrow 24-Aug at 5 PM. Visit Jio.comMyJio (company website and app) or nearest Jio retailerstore to prebook',“ another industry executive said. The phone will be distributed on a first-come-first-served basis through Jio retailers, multi-brand device retailers and the network of Reliance Digital stores. According to Reliance Digital store executives, if the JioPhone is pre-booked through the Reliance Industries retail unit, it should be collected from the specific Reliance store whose code would be SMSed to the customer."
"Reliance Jio, which has revolutionised the telecom market in India with its free voice calls and cheap data tariffs, is among the companies that paid the least licence fee and spectrum charges to the government. According to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), paid about Rs 8.26 crore as licence fee and Rs 14.83 crore as spectrum charges to the government in April-June 2017.



Bharti Airtel, on the other hand, paid Rs 1024.56 crore as licence fee and Rs 413.48 crore as spectrum charges during the quarter. It was followed by Vodafone, which paid Rs 677.72 crore as licence fee and Rs 320.06 crore as spectrum charges. Idea Cellular paid Rs 556.26 crore as licence fee and Rs 272.74 crore as spectrum charges.



pay 8 per cent of their adjusted gross revenue as licence fee and spectrum charges are in the range of 3-6 per cent for different operators depending on the type of air waves they have.



started charging for data from April, yet its adjusted gross revenue remained negative because of interconnect charges, which it paid to other operators for termination of calls. The interconnect charges currently stand at 14 paise per call. The Economic Survey also analysed the impact of on incumbent operators. It found Reliance Jio, which launched commercial services in September 2016, had forced incumbent firms to lower voice and data tariffs.



According to the Economic Survey, the price war and reduced revenue have trapped the sector into a highly leveraged one. The average revenue per user for the industry has come down by 32 per cent since September 2016. The outstanding debt of the industry is pegged at Rs 4.5 lakh crore, incurred mainly on account of payments for spectrum and other levies.

"Reports of only 3 out of 25 projects prepared till date

Mohinder Verma

JAMMU, Aug 23: Ignoring the explicit directions of Minister for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction, those at the helm of affairs in Jammu and Kashmir Projects Construction Corporation (JKPCC) are soft-paddling on submission of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of the works identified for execution under World Bank funded Rs 1500 crore Jhelum and Tawi Flood Recovery Project (JTFRP). The dilly-dallying approach is notwithstanding the fact that Government has been left with less than two years for utilization of such a whopping financial assistance.

Official sources told EXCELSIOR that Minister for Revenue, Relief, Rehabilitation, Reconstruction and Disaster Management Abdul Rehman Veeri, while chairing a meeting on July 26, 2017, fixed deadline of ending August for the start of major infrastructure build up works under Jhelum and Tawi Flood Recovery Project.

He, in the presence of all the concerned officers, even stressed for submission of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) by Jammu and Kashmir Projects Construction Corporation, which has been entrusted with the task of executing works relating to roads, bridges, schools and hospitals, by August 10 so that implementation of JTFRP doesn’t face any more delay.

“However, those at the helm of affairs in JKPCC have failed to pay any heed to the directions of the Minister”, sources said while disclosing that out of 25 Detailed Project Reports only three have been submitted by the Corporation to the concerned authorities till date thereby establishing that slackness continued to persist even after more than one and half years of signing of agreement between World Bank and Union Government for 250 Million US Dollar (Rs 1500 crore) credit agreement.

On the other side, Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) have made substantial progress vis-à-vis projects assigned to them under JTFRP, sources said while disclosing that both these agencies are in the process of procuring equipment and machinery, which are required for use in disaster management.

Expressing inability to specify time-frame for start of works assigned to JKPCC, sources said, “those at the helm of affairs in the Corporation are continuing slack approach despite being aware of the fact that after submission of DPRs the same are required to be vetted by the concerned agency before submission to the World Bank and it is only after the DPRs meet guidelines of the funding agency that works are actually started on ground”.

“It is matter of concern that JKPCC has failed to understand that roads, bridges, schools and hospitals are assets of vital public importance and it is only due to fast track execution of the works that objectives of the project would be achieved”, sources remarked while questioning the decision of the Government to allot such important works to the agency which is known for its casual approach and is already in the dock for delaying important projects.

The prevailing situation has once again brought to the fore the necessity of evolving unified operational system on the lines of Jammu and Kashmir Economic Reconstruction Agency. “The unwarranted delay in formulation of DPRs is mainly because Project Management Unit doesn’t have direct control over Project Implementing Units, which have their own Administrative Secretaries and Ministers”, sources said.

“Had the concerned authorities of the State Government and the World Bank team paid serious attention towards having unified operational system at the time of working out Project Implementation Arrangements the prevailing situation could have been avoided”, sources said, adding “if the Government doesn’t want to work out any such mechanism in respect of JTFRP it should at least make those at the helm of affairs in the Project Implementing Units like JKPCC to strictly adhere to the directions being issued from time to time so that works under World Bank funded project don’t meet the fate of other projects allotted to JKPCC”.

It is pertinent to mention here that in September 2014 J&K experienced torrential rains causing major flooding and landslides. The continuous spell of rains caused Jhelum, Chenab and Tawi Rivers as well as many other streams/tributaries to flow above the danger mark.

In the aftermath of devastating floods, the Government of India requested assistance from World Bank and after numerous visits by the team of World Bank the Union Government and World Bank signed 250 Million US Dollar credit agreement under the Jhelum and Tawi Flood Recovery Project in January 2016.

This project has seven components-reconstruction and strengthening of critical infrastructure; reconstruction of roads and bridges; restoration of urban flood management infrastructure; restoration and strengthening of livelihoods; strengthening disaster risk management capacity; contingent emergency response and implementation support.

"Researchers who warned half a dozen robot manufacturers in January, about nearly 50 vulnerabilities in their home, business and industrial robots, say only a few of the problems have been addressed.The researchers, Cesar Cerrudo and Lucas Apa of cyber security firm IOActive, said the vulnerabilities would allow hackers to spy on users, disable safety features and make robots lurch and move violently, putting users and bystanders in danger. While they say there are no signs that hackers have exploited the vulnerabilities, they say the fact that the robots were hacked so easily and the manufacturers’ lack of response raise questions about allowing robots in homes, offices and factories.“These robots don’t use bullets or explosives, but microphones, cameras, arms and legs. The difference is that they will soon be around us and we need to secure them before it’s too late,” said Apa.His comments come in the wake of a letter signed by more than 100 leading robotic experts urging the United Nations to ban the development of killer military robots, or autonomous weapons.  Apa, a senior security consultant, said that of the six manufacturers contacted, only one, Rethink Robotics, said some of the problems had been fixed.Apa said a review of updates from the other five manufacturers  Universal Robots of Denmark, SoftBank Robotics and Asratec Corp of Japan, Ubtech of China, and Robotis Inc of South Korea  led him to believe none of the issues he had raised had been fixed.The slow reaction by the robot industry was not surprising, said Joshua Ziering, founder of drone manufacturer Kittyhawk.io. “A new technology bursts on to the market and people fail to secure it,” he said.Cyber security experts said the vulnerabilities were alarming, and cyber criminals could use them to disrupt factories by ransomware attacks, or with robots slowed down or forced to embed flaws in the products they are programmed to build.This week, the researchers released details about the specific vulnerabilities they found, including one case where they mix several of them to hijack a Universal Robot factory robot, making it lurch about and be a potential threat. Reuters"
"Riki Wessels is also upbeat about his team’s chances in the Natwest t20 Blast. (Source: Reuters) Riki Wessels is also upbeat about his team’s chances in the Natwest t20 Blast. (Source: Reuters)

Nottinghamshire opening batsman Riki Wessels is upbeat about his team’s chances in the Natwest t20 Blast. This comes in the wake of the string of good performances that his side had put in the one-day format earlier. Wessels also revealed that he still intends to play international cricket for England but admitted that the duo of Alex Hales and Jason Roy have done well so far and hence doesn’t see a change in the top order.

Speaking to cricbuzz, Wessels said, “Having played in the Royal London One-Day Final, it would be nice to get to Finals Day and put ourselves in a position to win another white-ball competition. It’s happened a few times in the past couple of years when we have finished top of the group so it’s nice to finish top again. There were some good games in there and some good chases. Hopefully, we can take that form into tomorrow.”

“I’ve played T20 for quite a number of years and I’ve learnt what I’m capable of doing and I try to stick to the basic plan every time I bat. I don’t think much was really said to be honest,” said Wessels and added, “The guys sort of just crack on and play the way we feel we should play and how the wicket dictates. We’ve been fortunate this last year that the home wicket has been unbelievable at Trent Bridge. The scores have proven it’s been a batting paradise in T20 cricket.”

On the possible call-up for the national side, he said,”The desire to play international cricket for England is still there,” he said. “If it wasn’t, there would be no point in playing. But Alex and Jason [Roy] have done brilliantly so I don’t see that partnership changing any time soon.”

"RSS’s offshoot Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) has urged the government to not rely on dietary supplement packets to help malnourished children since it will benefit large corporations.

The SJM said the programme to begin ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF) begun in BJP-ruled Rajasthan and Maharashtra has proved to be an “expensive and unsustainable” exercise.

More than a third of all children in the country are underweight, government surveys have found, prompting officials to look at the option of feeding children RUTF. These food packets are usually a protein, carbohydrate, lipid and vitamins and minerals that are dissolved in water and given to children.

There is a need to define take-home ration, so that RUTF, “as projected by the vested interest lobby, is not accepted as norm”, the SJM said in a letter to the ministry of women and child development (WCD).

The SJM, which has earlier taken on the NITI Aayog for supporting privatisation of health care, is concerned that introducing RUTF would benefit private players.

“Our concern is that the current drive of managing this problem is only through ‘treatment’ of severe acute malnutrition children, that too with commercial ‘ready-to-use therapeutic foods’ (RUTF). This is an entry point for food industry and such packaged foods will satisfy the ‘hungry for profits’ food industry and not our children who need real food,” SJM’s Ashwani Mahajan has written.

SJM has alleged that that the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement that has roped in three state governments --Maharashtra, Jharkhand and UP--as its members have a business network called SBN with majority of its members in food businesses promoting ready-to-use foods.

“These members include Pepsi, Cargill, Nutriset, Britannia, Unilever, Edesia, General Mills, Glaxo SKB, Mars, Indofood, Nutrifood, DSM, Amul, and Valid Nutrition,” Mahajan has pointed out.

He said in Maharashtra, which is already using RUTFs under the National Health Mission supported by agencies like GAIN, ACF, and UNICEF, a Rs 100 crore plan has been floated to tackle malnutrition in rural areas with packed RUTFs to be given to each child three times a day for 72 days at cost of Rs. 25 per packet.

“India cannot afford to allow this dangerous trend to come in and tear apart its food system,” Mahajan has written.

The SJM has drawn attention to the prevalence of malnutrition, pointing out that more than 44 million children under the age of five remain chronically undernourished in India.

“The National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) data on child feeding and nutrition shows stunting is 38.4%; underweight is 35.7% and severely wasted is 7.5.India is currently reducing child under nutrition at the rate of 1 % per year which is not a satisfactory pace at all,” Mahajan wrote.

Pushing for a policy to guide the states on most sustainable and local solutions, which are indigenous, economical and culturally relevant, Mahajan said Indian data for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) children suggests that there is little difference between commercial ready to use foods or home augmented foods to treat SAM."
"Samsung in an extravagant event on Wednesday launched its flagship phone, Galaxy Note 8 in New York. With the latest launch, the South Korean firm aims to take on the iPhone 8, which is expected to be revealed in September or October.

Samsung is betting big with the Galaxy Note 8 especially after the Note 7 debacle. The firm would be keen to rebuild the Note brand with its fresh addition to the legacy as this has been its strongest weapon to take down the competition.

Let's take a look at what makes Galaxy Note 8 tick:

Specifications:

The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 has been the biggest Samsung phone ever, with a massive 6.3-inch QuadHD+ AMOLED Infinity Display of resolution 1440x2960.

It is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC along with 6GB of RAM. In India, we can expect the 64-bit Exynos 8895 variant, which would include 64GB of internal storage that could be further expanded up to 256GB via a microSD card slot.

Connectivity features include 4G with VoLTE, Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi 802.11ac and GPS. Running Android 7.1.1 Nougat with TouchWiz UX on top, the smartphone is expected to receive the Android Oreo update soon. A 3,300mAh battery completes the package.

The device supports wireless charging, a feature that the upcoming iPhone 8 is rumoured to feature as well.

Note 8 also has a fingerprint scanner and iris scanner for biometric authentication.

Camera:

This is the first Samsung flagship smartphone to sport dual-rear cameras. The new Galaxy Note 8 comes equipped with a dual-camera setup, out of which one is a 12MP wide-angle lens of aperture f/1.7, while the other is a 12MP telephoto lens of aperture f/2.4. It also includes an 8MP front-facing camera with optical image stabilisation.

How to buy?

The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 would be available in Midnight Black, Maple Gold, Orchid Grey, and Deep Sea Blue colours. It would be available for pre-orders in selected markets starting today, however, the shipping would only be commenced on September 15.

Samsung is also reportedly offering Galaxy Note 7 customers attractive discounts in order to encourage them to buy the Note 8.

Price:

In US, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 base variant is priced between $930 (roughly Rs. 59,500) on AT&T and $960 on (roughly Rs. 61,500) on Verizon.

However, in India, rumours suggest that the device would be an Amazon India exclusive."
"San Francisco If every city claims to be the `Silicon Valley' of its particular home country, you can guarantee Silicon Valley is the gold standard for tech. Since the region is identified by the largest neighbouring city, San Francisco takes the top spot. It is the epicenter of all things tech, from its gigantic startup culture to its venture capital scene to its population of designers and programmers. New YorkNew York is a special kind of tech heavyweight. It is both extremely dated in its infrastructure, but at the same time, unbelievably progressive.According to the state comptroller's office, nearly 7,000 high-tech companies in New York City provided more than 1,00,000 jobs during the third quarter of 2013. London London has become a public transportation dream with the introduction of its Crossrail project. By 2018, 10 new train lines will connect 30 existing stations with new tunnels. London also has more startups and programmers than almost any other city in the world. By some estimates, there may be more IT jobs in London than all of California. Los Angeles Film isn't the only industry in LA. In 2014, a report by the LA County Economic Development Corporation suggested that LA had more high-tech sector jobs than any other region in the US. The report found the total wealth output hovers around $58 billion. Seoul Seoul has been called the city of the future, and rightfully so.Innovation is practically baked into its design, as its metro system may even have New York's subway beat. Seoul files more patents than just about any city in the world. It has developed technology that is already ubiquitous. Taipei Taipei is the far-and-away leader when it comes to industrial design.This has been the case for years -the city much prefers to delve into hardware rather than software. Some of the largest PC companies call the city home, including Asus, MSI, Gigabyte, and Acer. Boston A lot of exciting technologies have been coming out of Boston over the last several years from STEM elites like MIT, Harvard, Tufts, and Northeastern -many of them in the biotech and robotic fields. The city has a handful of venture capital firms that pour money into innovation labs and university startups. Singapore Singapore boasts a high number of programmers and venture capitalists.The city-state is constantly introducing new infrastructure and high-tech high-rises, including one with an entire forest in the atrium. Toronto Rife with startups and innovative infrastructure, stemming from places like the Cisco Innovation Centre, Toronto is home to 30 per cent of Canada's IT firms, the majority of which have fewer than 50 employees.That means there's a crop of young companies poised to make an impact in the next decade. Chicago You might not think of the Midwest as a startup magnet, but Chicago is quickly proving that assumption false.A recent report found Illinois was among the top five in high-tech jobs in the US, with the Windy City making up a big chunk of those spots ."
"SATNA: A poisoned her classmate by mixing mosquito repellent in her , apparently envious of her for securing higher marks in exams. The accused girl later allegedly tried to commit suicide, fearing police inquiry into the incident, and was stated to be serious, an official said.  She put the liquid mosquito repellent into the water bottle of her classmate on Monday at their private school in the city. Later, the victim drank water from her bottle following which she complained of uneasiness and started vomiting. The girl was later taken to a hospital where she is undergoing treatment and is reported to be stable, Civil Lines police station in-charge said. ""Both the girls, aged around 13-14, study in the same class. After drinking water from her bottle, the victim suspected something unusual and told her friend that the water smelt like mosquito repellent. After she began to feel uneasy, the school administration informed her parents, who took her to a hospital,"" Singh said. ""In the CCTV footage of the classroom, the accused girl was seen pouring the mosquito repellent into her classmate's water bottle and then hiding it inside the bag of another student,"" Singh said.  Meanwhile, the accused allegedly tried to end her life by consuming mosquito repellent at her house in the city on Tuesday, as she feared a police inquiry into the incident, he said. A doctor at the district hospital said the accused's condition was serious. agencies"
"Saudi Arabia's revised Nitaq at (or Saudization) scheme, which will come into effect in September, could hit Indians hard as only companies with high grades will be able to apply for block visas for migrant staff, reports Lubna Kably . The grades will be based on, among other factors, the number of locals they recruit. The scheme, aimed at increasing jobs for Saudis, will cover private firms with six or more staffers. Construction and hospitality sectors, which have a predominantly blue collar Indian workforce, could be badly affected by the policy."
"Saudi Arabia's revised Nitaqat (or Saudisation) scheme does not bode well for Indian migrants. From September 2017, only a handful of organisations with high grades -based on number of Saudi nationals employed by them and other criteria -will be able to apply for new block visas for migrant employees. In 2016, there were nearly 25 lakh Indians working in Saudi Arabia, according to a reply in Lok Sabha. However, migration numbers are declining.There were only 1.65 lakh emigration clearances for Saudi Arabia in 2016, a decline by 46% from 2015. Top origin states in 2016 were Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar with Kerala being a distant fourth. The revised Nitaqat scheme, aimed at increasing employment opportunities for Saudi nationals, will cover private companies with six or more employees (as opposed to current criteria of 10 or more). Only organisations in the `Platinum' and `High Green' categories will be eligible for new block visas.Construction and hospitality, sectors which have a predominantly blue collar Indian workforce, are unlikely to gain from such rules. “Others can obtain visas for expat employees only through a transfer of sponsorship. In other words, these organisations will be limited to hiring expat workers who are already in Saudi Arabia and have a work visa with another employer,“ said an immigration alert from EY, a global professional services entity. “A majority of Indian workers are blue collar workers,“ said an immigration expert. “Organisations employing them -such as construction contractors or restaurants -are unlikely to fall in platinum and high green category .The added complexity is that workers already employed in companies falling in low categories cannot be transferred from one employer to another.It's currently unclear how employment needs of these sectors will be met in the future,“ he added. The Nitaqat system was first introduced in mid-2011 to encourage employment of Saudi nationals. Employers are divided into four categories, Platinum, Green (with three sub categories of high, medium and low), Yellow and Red. Those in Platinum have a higher proportion of Saudi nationals as employees (generally 40% or more). To determine an organisation's Nitaqat category, parameters used include: size and business activity; percentage of Saudi employees and average salary of such employees; retention rate of Saudi employees and percentage of Saudi national employees with high salaries. Highest weightage in computation is given to number of Saudis (ie: locals) employed by an organisation. Saudi Gazette, an English newspaper, citing the Saudi labour force survey results, wrote the number of non-Saudi employed persons for the first quarter of 2017 reached 108.5 lakh, nearly 78% of the total employed, which is 139 lakh.This report added that majority of foreign workforce comprised of Indians (30 lakh), Pakistanis (25 lakh) and Egyptians (22 lakh). In recent years, the Saudi government has also begun to introduce some sector-specific rules. For instance, departmental stores can only hire locals and not migrant workers.This step, according to Saudi newspapers, will release 20,000 jobs for the local population."
"Scientists have found a way to recycle human urine into food supplements and plastics, an advance that may make longduration space trips more feasible. Astronauts can not carry a lot of spare parts into space because every extra kilogram adds to the cost of fuel needed to escape the Earth's gravity. “If astronauts are going to make journeys that span several years, we will need to find a way to reuse and recycle everything they bring with them. Atom economy will become really important,“ said Mark A Blenner of Clemson University , US. The research, Blenner said, is geared towards developing a biological system that astronauts can awaken from a dormant state to start producing “what they need, when they need it“. The researchers have discovered that a yeast commonly found in cheese, Yarrowia lipolytica, which needs nitrogen and CO2 to grow, can obtain nitrogen from urea in untreated urine, and carbon from CO2 exhaled by the as tronauts or from, say, the Martian atmosphere.However, to use CO2, the yeast require a middleman to “fix“ the carbon into a form they can ingest. For this purpose, the yeast rely on photosynthetic cyano bacteria or algae provided by the researchers. One of the yeast strains produces omega-3 fatty acids, which contribute to heart, eye and brain health. Another strain has been engineered to churn out monomers and link them to make polyester polymers.Those polymers could then be used in a 3D printer to generate new plastic parts. Researchers are continuing to engineer this yeast strain to produce a variety of monomers that can be polymerised into different types of polyesters with a range of properties. For now, the engineered strains can produce only small amounts of polyesters or nutrients."

"SHABANA AZMIThe fight against triple talaq has been waged by very brave Muslim women such as Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan members. They have brought the issue centre stage. So when, in 2016, Shayara Bano petitioned the Supreme Court to challenge the constitutionality of the practices of triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy, several women’s groups emerged from the community such as Awaaz-e-Niswaan, Sahiyar, Muslim Mahila Manch, Pehchan, Muhim, Parvaaz Sangathan, and, more recently, Bebaak Collective. They joined forces and articulated a new radical politics, at one with progressive and feminist groups. It was a demonstration of the support system created by the women’s movement over the past three decades. The Supreme Court’s judgement against instant triple talaq is a welcome measure. Triple talaq in one go does not have religious sanction and is patently unjust and anti-women. More than 20 Muslim countries have banned it and it has no place in a secular India."
"Shajahan VK, an Islamic State (IS) sympathiser from Kerala who was deported from Turkey in July after a failed attempt to enter Syria, has revealed that 17 fellow Keralites have joined the terror group in SyriaIraq since January 2016. Shajahan and his friends Midlaj, Rashid and Abdul Razzak, however, had to return after Turkish authorities intercepted them at the Syrian border. Arrested by Delhi police upon deportation, Shajahan is now in judicial custody . The large number of Keralites living in IraqSyria, combined with the 21 Malayalis who had migrated to IS territory in Afghanistan last year and other IS sympathisers from the state deported from the Gulf since 2016, hint at the strong influence IS wields over sections of Kerala's youth. In fact, fresh estimates by the agencies say 70-80 Indian IS recruits may be in IraqSyriaAfghanistan, with the majority from Kerala. The government maintains IS has influenced very few youth in India. It had informed the Lok Sabha on August 2 that NIA and various state police had booked 54 persons till date for links with IS. According to the interrogation details of Shajahan accessed by TOI, the Kannur-born Shajahan was an active member of Kerala's hardline Islamic outfits -Popular Front of India, NDF and SDPI. He came in contact with Safvan, ar rested by NIA last year, during 200708. He also became friends with Manaf, Sameer and Shajil while working with PFI, and was directed by Sameer, who reached Syria with his family in January 2016, to go on hijra (religious journey) to IS territory along with Shajil and Manaf. Shajahan went to Malaysia in 2016 to enquire about getting an Iranian or Turkish visa for onward journey to Syria. However, he returned to Chennai and was asked by Manaf, who also reached Syria later via Dubai, to go to Malaysia again.Shajahan and Shajil took two other Keralites, Rashid and Midlaj, along.They went to Turkey via Iran. Shajil and Shajahan stayed in a flat in Istanbul, but Rashid and Midlaj were apprehended in a police raid at a separate flat and deported. Though Shajil and Shajahan lat er reached the Syrian border with fake Syrian refugee IDs, Shajahan and his family did not clear the border check as an Indian passport of his wife was found. Shajil, however, entered Syria. Back in Chennai, Shajahan got a fake passport and travelled to Thailand, en route to Syria, on March 31, 2017. He was joined by two other Keralites, Abdul Khayum and Abdul Razak. Later in Turkey , Shajahan, Khayum, Razak and others were taken to Antakya on the Syrian border but returned due to tight security. On the way back, some robbers fired at them and Shajahan and Razak hid in a place. Khayum managed to reach Syria. Shahjahan was caught by Turkish military on the Syrian border the next night and was deported."
"Sharapova was issued a two-year suspension after testing positive for the banned heart and blood boosting drug meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced the ban on appeal.(Photo: AP)

New York: Former world number one Maria Sharapova makes her first Grand Slam appearance next week since serving a 15-month doping suspension, bringing renewed passion and resolve to the US Open.

The 30-year-old Russian was given a wildcard into the tournament by the US Tennis Association (USTA), a move critics complained about earlier in the season but another key step in the road back for the five-time Grand Slam winner.

""When it comes to tennis, good or bad -- there's really only one thing that I know for certain -- I've missed it,"" Sharapova wrote on the Players' Tribune website. ""Though these last two years have been tougher so much tougher than I ever could have anticipated... my passion for the game has never wavered. If anything, it has only grown stronger.""

Sharapova was issued a two-year suspension after testing positive for the banned heart and blood boosting drug meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced the ban on appeal.

She said that she had taken it for several years and did not know it had been placed on the banned list at the start of 2016. Sharapova made her return in April at Stuttgart, reaching the semi-finals as a wildcard, but such invitations sparked criticism from some WTA rivals, saying she should have to work her way back without such benefits, some suggesting a life ban.

""I'm aware of what many of my peers have said about me and how critical of me some of them have been,"" she wrote. ""If you're a human being with a normal, beating heart... I don't think that sort of thing will ever fully be possible to ignore.""

Sharapova was refused a wildcard by French Open organizers and missed Wimbledon with a thigh injury, so the US Open will be her first Grand Slam event since last year's Australian Open.

Shaking off criticism after the French Open snub, Sharapova tweeted, ""If this is what it takes to rise up again, then I am in it all the way, everyday. No words, games or actions will ever stop me from reaching my own dreams. And I have many.""

Sharapova has missed three of the past four US Opens, her last visit ending in the 2014 fourth round.

The USTA defended its wildcard offer, saying, ""Her suspension under the terms of the tennis anti-doping program was completed and therefore was not one of the factors weighedin our wildcard selection process.""

""Consistent with past practice, a wildcard was provided to a past US champion who needed the wildcard for entry into the main draw."" Former world number one Sharapova won the 2006 US Open as well as Wimbledon in 2004, the 2008 Australian Open and the 2012 and 2014 French Opens.

""I'm sure this is a great moment for her to have an opportunity to be back to a place where she has done so well,"" seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams said.

Sharapova was bolstered by fans with ""Welcome back Maria"" signs in Germany and cheering support last month in Stanford, her first US match in more than two years.

""I feel like I just want to hug everyone and say thank you,"" Sharapova said. Sharapova defeated American Jennifer Brady 6-1, 4-6, 6-0 in her Stanford opener but suffered a left forearm injury and has not played competitively since. ""I feel like I'm playing catch-up against everyone who has had a head start,"" she said of being hurt during US Open tune up events."
"Sharwanand's upcoming film 'Mahanubhavudu', directed by Maruthi, has already gained attention from the Tollywood audience. Today on 24th August, the makers have released the first look poster of this youth-centric entertainer. The film has 'Krishnagadi Veera Premagadha' fam eMehreen Pirzanda as the female lead. Vennela Kishore, Bhanu, Himaja, Nasser, Bhadram, Kalyani Natraj, Venu and Sudarshan will be seen playing crucial roles in the film, produced by UV Creations.

The combination of this production house and director gave us Bhale Bhale Magadivoy which went on to become a huge blockbuster. Maruthi’s previous offering Babu Bangaram starring Venkatesh and Nayantara, was failed to impress the audiences and this time he is pinning lot of hopes on Maganubhavudu. The film has the music by SS Thaman and is expected to hit screens on the occasion of Dussehra."
"She has not been seen in a Hindi film since Freaky Ali. The actress is still taking Hindi lessons on Skype while she maintains that she can have conversations in Tamil.  However, the savvy girl is crystal clear about what her category is in B-Town, and has been unencumbered by role limitations. While she is doing well in the South and is even part of an Indo-Brit film now, there is a feeling she isn’t serious about Bollywood. In a freewheeling interface with After Hrs, Amy clears the air...Do you feel that you lose out on a lot of films because of the language handicap? I think it’s always on people’s minds. That’s why they cast me in particular roles. Obviously, they don’t expect me to do a village belle’s role with perfect Hindi. That’s not my category, I suppose. But the roles that are available aren’t a problem for me. How do you communicate with South directors? Do you have a translator?  No, I have not done that actually, up till now. I was doing The Villain and that’s a totally different language. I feel at home in Chennai. I can have conversations in Tamil and I can understand everything. So no one can get away with anything (laughs). The Villain is a totally new territory and I am working with Apeksha from Akshay’s (Kumar) team. Akshay spoke in Hindi in 2.0, but it had to relate to the Tamil audience so when they dubbed it, the sync was there. Apeksha helped him on the sets and she was wonderful. I have stolen her and taken her now for The Villain. She speaks five to six different languages. So it’s nice to have that insight from her (smiles). Are you dubbing for the film in different languages?Yes, I think so. I guess they even plan to dub it in Chinese and release it there. Obviously, I won’t be speaking Chinese (laughs)! But yes, others languages I will be dubbing. Are you well-versed with Hindi now?I am still learning Hindi. I take my classes. I Skype occasionally with my tutor and I am speaking Tamil in 2.0. There, I had my tutor on sets for the dialogues. That was nice. It’s become a routine. So when I’m in Mumbai, I take classes here, otherwise, when I’m traveling, I am learning on Skype."

"SHO SUSPENDED AS ONLY TWO COPS AGAINST THE REQUIRED FOUR WERE ON THE PATROL DUTY SBSNAGAR: Three unidentified carborne thieves tried to run over a head constable in Langroya village, branded as ‘village of drug addicts’, on the intervening night of August 23 and 24. The cops were on a regular patrol when they spotted the accused trying to steal from a medical shop on Jalandhar-Chandigarh highway. An FIR under Sections 186, 353, 380, 457 and 511 of the IPC has been registered against unidentified persons. As per complaint, head constable rapid rural police response system Paramjeet Singh said, he along with another cop Ram Aasra were patrolling in Baghera village and moved to check Punjab and Sind Bank ATM in Langroya village. He said when they reached the main road at 2.10am, they found two unidentified men trying to open a shutter of the medical store and their accomplice was sitting in a white Swift. The head constable said that when Aasra tried to stop them, a car- borne accomplice tried to run over him. Two others attacked Aasra with an iron rod, he said. To save himself, Aasra opened fire, said Singh. Later the three managed to flee from the spot and left the car behind including a mobile. Sadar SHO Ajay Kumar has been suspended on the count of negligence, said SSP Satinder Singh. As per sources, four cops including an ASI in a Bolero are required during patrolling.

"SINGAPORE: A spate of incidents involving US warships in Asia, has forced the navy to consider whether cyberattackers might be to blame. While some experts believe that being able to engineer such a collision would be unlikely, given the security systems of the US Navy and the logistics of having two ships converge, others say putting the recent incidents down to human error and coincidence is an equally unsatisfactory explanation. The chief of US naval operations Admiral John Richardson said on Monday he could not rule out some kind of outside interference or a cyber attack being behind the latest collision, but said he did not want to prejudge the inquiry. SEVENTH FLEET CHIEF REMOVED FROM POST The US Navy on Wednesday said it had removed Seventh Fleet commander Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin after a series of collisions involving its warships in Asia. Aucoin’s removal comes days after a pre-dawn collision between a guided-missile destroyer and a merchant vessel east of Singapore and Malaysia on Monday, the fourth major incident this year."
"Sixteen years after she charmed the pants off of the audience as the younger Poo (Pooja Sharma, played by Kareena Kapoor) in Karan Johar's Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (K3G), Malvika Raaj is set for a grown-up debut as Emraan Hashmi's love interest in the Tony D'Souza directed Captain Nawab, in which the 38-year-old actor plays an army officer. Malvika admits that after a month-and-a-half of auditions and look tests, she is glad to have bagged the part. “It's a performance-oriented role. I liked the script. As part of my prep, I will be learning Urdu and Punjabi and have already begun workshop,“ informs the actress, adding that Emraan will join the workshop after the release of Baadshaho.

I start shooting in mid-October in Mumbai, Emraan starts before me,“ she informs, admitting that although she had known she wanted to be an actress even before K3G happened, the film only cemented her resolve. After K3G, Malvika's father insisted that she complete her studies before pursuing films further. “I graduated in commerce but contin ued training in dance and martial arts and also learnt acting from Anupam Kher's institute. I was not the best in studies but remained at the forefront in extra-curriculars like dramatics and dance,“ she says, adding that she had become quite popular among peers after K3G released. “I loved every bit of the attention.“"

Rajkummar Rao was never the quintessential Bollywood hero, but he is a force to reckon with, winning viewer appreciation, awards, and box office success. But for all his talent, the path to the centre-stage was once blocked by the barb wire of rejection. “Going back four or five years, I can definitely recall a couple of incidents where people told me, ‘We can’t cast you for the lead role; we’d rather take you for some other part.’ I think that’s because they all try and play safe and be secure, because the [financial] risk is really big when it comes to filmmaking,” says Rajkummar. In seven years in Bollywood, he was part of an ensemble cast in Kai Po Che (2013); carried an arthouse film, Shahid (2013), as the solo lead, with a performance that won him a National Film Award; had strong supporting roles in the big hit Queen (2014) and the critically acclaimed Aligarh (2014); and plays a quirky romantic character in this year’s Bareilly Ki Barfi. The 32-year-old says he’s Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s film Padmavati might miss its release date of November 11. According to Mid Day, the film’s shoot is facing problems due to the ongoing Federation of Western India Cine Employees strike. The film team faces a technician shortage. The Forbes list of highest paid actors, and Indian actors Shah Rukh Khan ($38 million), Salman Khan ($37 million) and Akshay Kumar ($35.5 million) have made it to the list at the 8th, 9th and 10th position respectively. Actor Aamir Khan is not in the list, despite his mega-hit Dangal. films in the Conjuring film franchise. “We had no pressure on us as such, to make it as popular as the first Conjuring film,” says Sigman. “It was a really good story, and the character I’m playing was pretty challenging. I hope that people are able to watch the film without any biases.” Stephanie also reveals that she is good friends with actor Bárbara Mori, and loved her in the Bollywood film Kites, co-starring Hrithik Roshan. “I know a lot about Bollywood,” she says, “thanks to Bárbara, who is like my best friend. I absolutely love [Kites], and I’ve become a big fan of Hrithik Roshan as well.” glad things have changed. “It’s a pretty different scenario that we see in [Bollywood] today. Audiences want to see more mainstream actors playing characters first, no matter [if it is] the lead or a supporting role. That outlook has brought about a lot of change,” says Rajkummar, giving credit for this transformation to the newer bunch of filmmakers and writers. “They’re penning amazing stories. They don’t write a script thinking if [certain] actors will do a [certain] part or not. That’s why we see even superstars playing characters,” he adds. Fellow actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui had said that racial bias in Bollywood led to filmmakers not casting top female actors against some male actors. Rajkummar quips that he himself has worked with “some really pretty girls — be it Kangana Ranaut, Sonam Kapoor, Shruti Haasan or Vidya Balan”, but adds, “I can understand where Nawaz is coming from”. He further says, “I don’t think [Nawaz] has anything to worry about, because his talent is bigger than anything.” The so-called ‘child abuse’ video, which has gone viral after stinging comments on it by top cricketers, most notably Virat Kohli, shows a little girl who turns out to be the niece of Bollywood singers Toshi and Sharib Sabri. Reacting to the vitriolic criticism being directed online at the child’s mother, Toshi Sabri says that a 90-second video is no basis for judging his sister’s parenting skills. About the child, a three-yearold named Haya, he says, “Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan don’t know about us. Hamare bachche ke bare mein humein pata hai naah ki hamara bachcha kaisa hai!” Toshi says that Haya would run off to play a minute after being scolded, and usually had to be pushed a bit to study. Haya’s mom made the video for her family’s WhatsApp group. She hadn’t expected this online attention. Virat’s comment on Instagram blamed the parent (not seen in the video) for ignoring “the pain and anger of the child” and alleged that “compassion has totally gone out of the window”. He also wrote: “A child can never learn if intimidated.” This post got millions of views. Yuvraj Singh, Robin Uthappa, and Shikhar Dhawan added their FILMMAKER the role. Regarding the qualities the makers are looking for in the actor, a source says that he must look younger than Tejasswi Prakash, who plays Ratan’s wife. “It will be great if we get a fresh face. Whoever is showing interest is being asked to perform a scene from the show,” adds the source. Pehredaar Piya Ki has been in the news for quite some time now. The show, which revolves around a nine-year-old prince married to an 18-year-old girl, has been getting flak for its regressive content. Recently there was a petition to the Information and Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani, who asked Broadcasting Content Complaints Council (BCCC) to look into the matter. The BCCC asked the makers to change the time slot and also run a disclaimer saying that the show doesn’t promote child marriage. SINGER-COMPOSER voice to Kohli’s criticism. Toshi responds that it’s okay for a parent to overlook the tantrums of the child if it’s for the sake of education. “Woh jo rona hota hain, woh uss moment ke liye tha, taaki usski maa usse padaaye na aur"

"Something is up in Bellflower, California - citizens there seem to have a lot of bile to spew.

Nearly a third of all the online comments made by people living in the Southern California city over the last 16 months were hostile or toxic, according to a new report by Wired that was based on data from Disqus. That proportion of hostile comments was 335% higher than proportion for the rest of the state, according to the report.

The magazine and Disqus, a company that offers online discussion services for web sites, analyzed 92 million comments from internet users nationwide that were left over a 16-month period. The magazine and Disqus defined toxic comments as ones that are "" rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable"" and that would be likely to make someone ""leave a discussion.""

Some 32.7% of the comments coming from Bellflower qualified as toxic. By comparison, only 8.1% of the comments emanating from neighboring Los Angeles were considered as toxic.

So what's Bellflower's problem? On the surface, it doesn't seem to be a bad place. But who knows what angers the trolls."

As is the practice, they demanded Rs 11,000 since the developers have a construction site in Hadapsar which is why the accused wanted the donation.The senior consultant and another employee present in the office spoke to the trio and explained that they would not be able to pay them anything this year since the company was in bad shape. Enraged, the trio started abusing and beating up the consultants and damaged some property in the office.Senior PI of Deccan PS Ajay Kadam said, “After a night and day-long search, we arrested Malkyasingh and Aniket on Wednesday and will produce them in court on Thursday. All three of them are daily wage labourers and have different jobs every day.”"
Star striker Sunil Chhetri was among the goal-getters as Bengaluru FC thrashed 4.25 SC of DPR Korea 3-0 in in the first leg of the inter-zone semifinal of the AFC Cup. Chhetri led the charge with a 32nd minute strike before Udanta Singh and Lenny Rodrigues found the target in the 51st and 78th minutes to help Bengaluru register an emphatic win in the rain-hit match amidst the cheering home crowd. Chhetri broke the deadlock in the 32nd minute by converting a penalty after Udanta was brought down by goalkeeper Ri Kang inside the area.
"Stars expanding their name recognition is nothing new for celebrities and it only seems natural that a celeb entrepreneur also turns into a restaurateur. Earlier this year, cricketer opened the first restaurant in India to serve South American food, Nueve which is located in South Delhi's culinary hotspot Sangam Courtyard. But despite the fanfare, it doesn't even come close to hitting the spot as there is more to creating and owning a successful restaurant than coming up with a catchy name, picking the chef, and telling him or her to put fancy names on the menu. The column below discusses the good, bad and ugly of in India.





My wife and I were in Delhi last month. Since I had read a lot of media hype about Virat Kohli’s new restaurant, Nueva, we opted to head there for dinner with some friends. I had high hopes. All of Virat’s PR tom-tomed that Nueva served authentic South American food, and the menu had inspirations from Spain, Italy, Portugal, France and Japan. Some interesting Asian food too was supposed to be on offer. ‘From pan-seared duck to Peruvian piscos, the restaurant has some unique signature dishes that are bound to wow you’ promised press write-ups about Nueva.

I am an unabashed fan. I was sure young Kohli had brought the same excellence he displays on the cricketing field on to the dining table. We were not disappointed. The ambience was nice. Upmarket, classy. We were welcomed with warm smiles. The restaurant was full. A mix of yuppies, and family crowd. There was a nice, friendly air to the eatery.

The menu selection seemed eclectic. For starters, we ordered Panko con Costra Palitos de Pescado, a flavoured soft buttery fish ensconced in crunchy panko and sprinkled over with tomato dust, Pollo Rojo con Salsa de Pimenton y Romero, chunks of chicken simmered in a vibrant red wine sauce with the kick of paprika, fragrance of rosemary and hints of garlic and Chorizo de Cordero con Papas, Portuguese style Chorizo and potatoes cooked in a spicy concasse flavoured with red wine. For the vegetarians, we added Tostada des Alcachofa Marinada, soft artichokes marinated with lemon and spice, tossed in a chunky Chilean Walnut sauce stuffed in a spongy brioche and Croquetas de Hongos y Queso, cheese and potato croquettes rolled in panko crumbs and fried to crispness. Someone asked for a portion of Nduja, a special blend of pork sausage, from Calabria in Italy.

To be honest, the food disappointed. Seriously disappointed. The portions were small. Too little to pass-around. And the food descriptors, basis which we had ordered the food, were exaggerations all the way. The dishes were just ordinary. Well presented. But insipid to taste. Style, yes, substance no. We were not new to the cuisine, having partaken some really exotic stuff during our recent trip to Peru. The dishes at Nueva lacked authenticity. And taste.

I won’t get into the details of the rest of the meal. The experience of the starters was repeated through the main course and the desserts. Big promises. Small portions. Dull food. I felt cheated. I asked to see the Chef, a gentleman called Michael Swamy. Sensing my mood, the staff told me Chef Swamy had ‘just left for the day’.

Why would someone like launch Nueva? It is a question I have not found a ready answer to. Kohli already has a stake in the ISL team, FC Goa; he is invested in the ITPL through UAE Royals where Roger Federer plays for the franchise; he owns Chisel gyms; he is part owner of Wrogn, a youth fashion brand; he has invested in Sportsconvo.com, a London based sports fans forum. And the list goes on. But why a restaurant?

is not the first, and surely, not the last celebrity to be enticed by the glamour of the restaurant business. If memory serves me right, Kapil Dev was the first to set up Sixer, a resto-bar way back in 1982 in his home town Chandigarh inside his Hotel Kapil which is now called Kaptain’s Retreat. Tendulkar’s came up in Mumbai a few years ago. There was a Sachin’s too a little later. Both, from none else but the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, in collaboration with hotelier Sanjay Narang. Sourav’s - The Food Pavilion came up in 2004 in Kolkata’s upmarket Park Street, owned by the former Indian captain, Sourav Ganguly. Pacer launched ZK’s and then Zaheer Khan’s Fine Dine. He also launched a bar, Toss. Not to be left behind, all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja launched Jaddu’s Food Field in Rajkot in 2012. The Nawab of Najafgarh, Virender Sehwag too launched Sehwag’s Favourites in Delhi. Ajay Jadeja too tried his hand with hospitality, launching an Italian restaurant, Senso in Delhi. Robin Uthappa and S Sreesanth launched The Bat and Ball in Bangalore. Harbhajan Singh was to launch Bhajji Da Dhaba, but I don’t know if he actually ever did.

Indian cricketers were not alone in their love for good food (and drink!). Chris Gayle launched Triple Century Sports Bar (333) in Kingston, Jamaica; Mohammad Ashraful started Sichuan Garden in Dhaka; while Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara inaugurated The Ministry of Crab in Colombo.

The sad story on almost all of the above is that every single one of the above restaurants has either shut down after inglorious innings, or exists in doldrums. The only visible exception to the above list is The Ministry of Crab which I have personally visited a couple of times in Sri Lanka. It serves outstanding sea food and is one of the busiest restaurants in the capital city of Colombo. Most others have teetered and toppled after making no visible or lasting mark on the gourmet map.





The best example of a celebrity-plus-chef combination, without doubt, is Nobu, one of the finest Japanese restaurants in the world. Robert De Niro teamed up with Chef Nobu Matsuhisa to launch this much talked about box office success way back in 1994 in New York. Nobu today has restaurants across 30 cities including New York, Bahamas, Beijing, Budapest, Cape Town, Dallas, Dubai, Hong Kong, Las Vegas, London, Berkeley St. (London), Los Angeles, Malibu, Melbourne, Mexico City, Miami, Milan, Moscow, Next Door (NY), Fifty Seven (NY), Perth, San Diego, Tokyo and Waikiki. I have been to Nobu at NY, Dubai, Las Vegas and Tokyo. The food is consistently great, not a notch short. Table reservations require advance planning. The restaurants are abuzz at all times. And, there is star-gazing in abundance to go with to-die-for sushi and sashimi. Nobu has obviously got the celebrity-plus-chef combination right. Perhaps needs to go there for inspiration.

Besides the enormous success of Nobu, there are other examples too of global celebrities who meandered into food. Jay-Z’s 40/40 Club met with moderate success. Eva Longoria, star of the hit TV show Desperate Housewives, got together with Chef Todd English to develop a Latin inspired steak and seafood restaurant, Beso. It flopped. Ashton Kutcher’s old-world-Italy-meets-Hollywood-chic restaurant Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante opened in Los Angeles and a couple of other locations but closed down. Jennifer Lopez’s, Madres, opened in Pasadena, CA with the promise of being ‘a family restaurant with a little bit of sexiness to it’ but failed to make any dent. Britney Spears’ Nyla got consistently bad reviews and was shuttered. Francis Ford Coppola’s Rustic survives because of its location on his winery in Sonoma County. Bon Jovi’s Soul Kitchen is a no-prices-on-the-menu restaurant and flourishes because of its charm. 10 years after it launched, Justin Timberlake’s Southern Hospitality continues to do well because of its barbeque offering and southern style ambience.

If most cricketers in India have failed to register centuries with their restaurants, other celebrities too have had mixed success with restaurants. Nagarjuna’s N Grill in Hyderabad is supposed to be doing well. Mollywood star Dileep’s Dhe Puttu which serves Kerala cuisine is said to be popular too. His Mollywood colleague Prithviraj has a very successful restaurant Spice Boat in Qatar. So also Asha Bhosle whose Asha’s is quite a rage in Dubai. Bollywood stars have had their ups-and-downs with Gondola (Perizaad Zorabian), Mischief/H2O (Suniel Shetty), Lap - The Lounge (Arjun Rampal), Royalty (Shilpa Shetty Kundra), Monarch (Mithun Chakrobarty), Someplace Else (Bobby Deol) and Crepe Station (Dino Morea). I believe there is a restaurant in Bandra called Bhai Jaan blessed by Salman Khan, but I am not sure if the connection and patronage is official.

In the final analysis, forays into food by celebrities by-and-large have been iffy. More failures than successes. Celebrity ownership does act as an initial draw, but once the enthusiasm and sampling ebbs, most such restaurants flounder. The reasons are not far to seek. A good restaurant is first and foremost about food. Unfortunately, are so blinded by the aura and fame of the owner that this essential focus on food is invariably not there. Food is merely seen as a by-product of the celebrity’s magnetism, which it surely is not. Another important dimension of a good restaurant is the service. Because of their initial success guaranteed by the celebrity name, most such restaurants tend to inherit the ego and brash attitude of their celebrity owners turning back customers in the good times. When the novelty wears off, the customers just do not come back.

Back to where we started, needs to take some time out of his busy cricketing calendar to revisit the basics at Nueva. The presentation is fine but the portions and the food itself needs serious attention. If not addressed sufficiently and quickly, Nueva may just join the long list of celebrity failures that left a bad taste in the mouth.

Sandeep Goyal is a business columnist, commentator and critic. He is also Chief Tasting Officer (CTO) of FoodFood, the 24x7 TV channel, that he co-owns with celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor So, why do such enterprises fail? Primarily, I think, out of lack of understanding of the domain. On the face of it, it looks easy to do. Especially when the cricketer invariably partners someone who claims knowledge of the hospitality business. But not all choices are obviously wise. I am told that Sehwag’s venture ended up in litigation with his business partners. While casting no personal or professional aspersions, I am told Virat Kohli’s chef, Michael Swamy was in charge of the back kitchen of the television show Master Chef, not a particularly celebrated CV to have. If Kohli was looking to launch a top-of-the-line eatery, he could perhaps have looked for someone with better credentials and higher in the pecking order of chefs in India.

"State oil companies have raised prices of petrol and diesel by ` . 3.72 . 5.64 per litre and ` per litre respectively since July 1 through daily revisions that have largely gone unnoticed. In Delhi, petrol was being sold for `. 68.73 a litre and diesel for . 57.05 a litre on Wednesday, ac` cording to the website of Indian Oil Corp. On July 1, the prices of petrol and diesel were ` . 63.09 and ` . 53.33 a litre. Prices in other states would vary due to local levies. Petrol, diesel as well as jet fuel, crude oil and natural gas are not in the ambit of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and covers most goods and services, including petroleum products such as cooking gas and lubricants. Prices of petrol, diesel, cooking gas and kerosene have historically been politically sensitive as these directly impact households' budget and have the potential to induce inflation. This is why prices of cooking gas and kerosene are still controlled. Until June 15 this year, state oil companies used to fortnightly revise prices to align them with international rates and factor in currency fluctuation though price hikes were skipped or delayed in some fortnights to avoid political controversy, especially during polls.From June 16, companies switched to daily revision. This meant the price changes would be so small that it would skip the attention of most consumers or opposition parties. With a steep hike of 9% and 7% seen in petrol and diesel since July 1, it appears that the aims of daily revision are being neatly met. Open Up Oil Marketing Quicker revision to better align prices with ET VIEW rising costs (of imports) is all very well, but we do need to revamp market design in the huge retail oil sector.India is now the world's third largest oil importer, and we do need genuine competitive pressures to boost efficiency, raise productivity and bring down prices in oil retailing. There's no point in ring-fencing oil sales for only oil companies. What's required is proactive policy for independent retailers of oil products. Abroad, in the mature markets, “independents“ account for about half the retail off-take of petroleum products."
"SUBHAJOY ROY Calcutta, Aug. 23: The Calcutta Municipal Corporation and CESC have started joint inspections of electric poles, transformers and feeder boxes across the city to fix glitches, if any. The move comes in the wake of allegations that people were electrocuted from downed power lines on flooded roads. At least three people have died till now since the last monsoon. Teams have been formed to inspect the installations in every ward. The exercise started about a week ago and is likely to be wrapped up before the Puja, a civic official said. "" Two people died in Ekbalpore this year. It was very unfortunate. We want to ensure that all problems are fixed,"" mayor Sovan Chatterjee said after a meeting with CESC officials at the civic headquarters today. "" The teams will check transformers, lamp posts, distribution boxes and trident lights."" On June 19, two people were electrocuted while walking down Dent Mission Row in Ekbalore when it was raining. Residents of the area said the two had touched a wire dangling from a transformer. Last August, a 14- year- old Yash Bengani had got electrocuted when his hand entered the opening of a lamp post on Ramesh Mitra Road in Bhowanipore. People had said the boy possibly tried to stay on his feet on the flooded road after being thrown off balance by a moving car. The lid of the opening on the lamp post had possibly been opened since someone carried out maintenance work. The joint team will check if such lids have been kept open anywhere else in the city. There are 270,000 lamp posts in the city, a civic official said. The civic body owns 200,000 of these while CESC owns the rest. There are 10,000 transformers and 7,000 feeder boxes."

"T he more things change, the more they remain the same. This is not always a good thing in India — here, the ruling dispensation talks of bullet trains while accidents involving existing trains occur with alarming frequency. There have been close to 590 rail accidents in the past five years, of which about 53 per cent have involved derailments. The most recent of these are the derailments of the Utkal Express and the Kaifiyat Express. These mishaps ought to surprise no one, for they point to the appalling lack of maintenance and security that the Indian Railways has gained notoriety for. The railways has always been a distinct undertaking which, until recently, drew a separate budget as well. In spite of that, there has been a marked lack of investment in rail infrastructure, compounded by the populism- driven unwillingness of successive governments to raise passenger fares — a crucial step towards implementing rail reforms. As a result of this, maintenance work and safety measures have been affected so badly that the Indian Railways, in spite of being an engineering marvel and one of the greatest achievements of modern India, lags shamefully behind the rail networks of developed countries in terms of both safety and comfort. The picture grows bleaker in the light of the almost insurmountable volume of repair work required. A reported 40 per cent of India's railway tracks are in desperate need of repair; the resignation of the chairman of the Railway Board does nothing to solve that problem. In fact, it merely deflects from the need for political accountability and workable solutions. Should existing tracks — some of which are close to 200 years old — be fixed or replaced? If new tracks have to be built, should they be constructed at an elevation? Most important, how is all of this to be paid for? Given that it is struggling to dredge up funds, the government should raise fares for first- class passengers, even if it does not do so for less- privileged travellers. Instead, in keeping with its ad hoc planning, it increased rail freight charges, thereby making rail transportation of cargo a less viable option than road freight. The government's lack of concern for the upkeep of the railways becomes apparent when its progress in other ways is taken into account. The Indian Railways has a robust online presence; passengers can book tickets on its website and even have them delivered at home. This shows that progress can be achieved if there is the political will to do so. However, that will does not seem to extend to ensuring the safety of citizens."
"TAIPEICITY: The last decade in athletics belonged to Usain Bolt but the legendary Carl Lewis is not happy with the singular focus on the Jamaican showman. Bolt drew curtains on his career after a disappointing performance at the World Championship in London. “The sport is not just about one person. Nobody is irreplaceable. Track and field survived many civilizations. Jesse Owens, Carl Lewis, Michael Johnson and now Usain Bolt.

If anything, it has only grown stronger,” she said. FEDEX-NADAL MEETING? NEW YORK: Their rivalry has stretched 13 years and 37 matches but Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer have never met at the US Open, a staggering anomaly which seems certain to be corrected at 2017’s concluding Grand Slam. Nadal is a two-time winner in New York, while Federer, the five-time US champion, is bidding for a 20th major and third of the year after capturing the Australian Open and Wimbledon titles."
"Taking a dig at ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) for allowing open cast mining in Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) in Bhoopalpally district, Maoists put out posters against Assembly Speaker S Madhusudhana Chary , his three sons and other leaders. The Speaker represents the Bhoopalpally Assembly constituency . The posters, purportedly issued in the name of secretary of Karimnagar-Khammam-Warangal division, were found pinned to tree trunks in the SCCL mining area. They claim that acquisition of land for open cast Phase II from farmers would badly affect Shanthinagar, Shaktishanipally and Bambulgadda villages. The poster said the SCCL has been acquiring thousands of acres from farmers in the name of open cast mining. Earlier, 1,500 acres were acquired for the first phase and, there was an alleged scam in acquiring 100 acres. “The then government conducted an inquiry and cases were booked against only eight people and but were not arrested yet. The TRS government which was in opposition then is now ruling the state, but it seems to have turned a colluder,“ the poster said. The Maoist party also mentioned the names of some local leaders and warned them of dire consequences. When contacted, Bhoopala pally superintendent of police R Bhaskaran said they were investigating whether they were genuine Maoist posters or fake ones. “During Maoist Week celebrations, a similar poster was put out on July 27. We suspect the posters were put out by some local leaders in the name of Maoists,“ the SP said. However, the police are on extra vigil in the wake of posters in the name of Maoists. Sources in the police department said Damodar alias Bade Chokka Rao, a native of Mulugu of erstwhile Warangal district, is also a state committee member of Maoists. In May , a poster, purportedly released by Rachakonda dalam, surfaced targeting chief minister KCR and local legislator P Shekar Reddy . But the Rachakonda police, after investigation, denied the role of Maoists and attributed it to political rivals of Shekar Reddy . Telangana police said that as of now there are about 140 Maoists of Telangana and AP region, whose activities are most ly restricted to Chhattisgarh.The Maoists who hail from Telangana are trying to make their presence felt in the stage by attempting to revive their lost ground. But the Special Intelligence Bureau (SIB) has foiled many revival attempts. After the formation of Telangana state, a separate state committee was formed but till now they could not revive their presence or make any fresh recruitment in the CPI (Maoist) party . However, at KhammamChhattisghhar border, the Greyhounds unit and district police have always been on the toes. In the last few years, there have been instances of machinery belonging to various road contractors being set blaze in various districts. In the last three years, about five Maoists were killed by police during encounters in state. However, till date majority of the CPI (Maoist) central committee members hail from Telangana including Muppalla Lakshman Rao alias Ganapathi, general secretary of CPI (Maoists)."

"telling lies. “He (Kumar) had once said he would prefer being ruined (mitti mein mil jayenge) than to join hands with the BJP. But now, he has fallen at the BJP’s feat,” said Prasad. The RJD chief said he had asked the participants of his ‘Desh Bachao, Bhajapa Bachao’ rally, in Patna, on August 27, to come with one fistful of soil for the CM. On Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bihar to oversee flood situation, Prasad said the PM was coming here to discuss the BJP’s plan of preponing the state elections and hold it along with Lok Sabha polls, due in 2019. “Modi is coming here to divert the people’s attention from the RJD rally. What is meaning of his visit, when flood is on receding trend,” asked the RJD leader. Regarding the participation of leaders of other parties in the RJD rally, Prasad claimed that Congress’ Ghulam Nabi Azad and CP Joshi would represent the party in the programme, while BSP chief Mayavati had deputed Satish Mishra to attend it. “JD(U) Rajya Sabha member Sharad Yadav and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee are among those slated to address the rally,” said the RJD chief."
"Ten detonators that were in the possession of a Central Railway (CR) guard, were stolen from his bag at Panvel station on August 3. The explosive devices pose a safety risk, if used incorrectly . Efforts are being made to trace the “railway track signals“. “In case of an emergency like a derailment or engine failure due to which a train comes to a halt. The guard walks nearly 1km from the rear of the affected train and places a detonator on the track. These railway track signals blow up, creating a loud noise and alert an approaching train,“ said a senior CR official. The theft assumes importance in view of suspected incidents of track sabotage. “It is a serious matter and the culprits should be traced. A person with the knowledge of such devices can wreak havoc with train operations.“ said a CR guard. Sources said the detonators were kept in a bag that every guard of a longdistance train carries with him. The bag also contains other railway track signal accessories. “The guard went on leave last month after depositing his bag of detonators with Panvel station officials. On resuming duty after four days, he could not locate it. When the bag was eventually found, he noticed that its lock had been broken and articles, including detonators were missing.“ said an official. The detonators are supplied to Indian Railways by the Indian Ordnance Factory , Pune. “We have received an application from the Railways about the theft. However, since there are railway goods missing we are going to ask the Railway Protection Force to investigate the matter,“ said an inspector of theGRP in Panvel."
"THANE: More than 1,000 girls and 380 specially-abled students from the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) schools got a chance to visit a multiplex for the first time on Wednesday. The corporation, along with an NGO, had organised a screening of the movie, Toilet: Ek Prem Katha, for girl students of civic schools. The screening was organised to create awareness about the importance of having an individual toilet and take initiative to stop open defecation. Manish Joshi, education officer of TMC, said, “Students from economically weaker sections have to use community toilets or defecate in the open. The movie puts across the point that if women take initiative, the problem of open defecation can be solved.” “It also shows how women have to face major problems due to lack of individual toilets. We wanted to create awareness among our students, who can insist on individual toilets in their homes,” said Joshi. The Thane Citizen Voice and Maharashtra GO Green Foundation supported the corporation in the initiative. Kasber Augustine, founder of these NGOs said, “The aim was to put across a message to the children about hygiene and open defecation.” Sri Narayan Singh, director of the movie, who was also present at the screening, said, “The idea of the movie was to educate the country and change the mindset of the people. It is essential for every house to have a toilet.”"

"The balcony in your apartment can be easily turned into a mini garden if you set it up smartly .Almost any spot in the house -be it windowsills, entrances or corridors -can be made to bloom with choicest plants and right planters. For those who have busy schedules, bag gardening is an easy way to grow vegetables or flowers. “It is comparatively a new trend in gardening. Growing bags come in handy if you are planning to start a kitchen garden. They are light-weight and economical too. You can grow vines like pumpkins or gourds easily .Unlike tins or other metal containers, they do not heat up and are waterproof. They can hold a lot of soilless medium easily. You can also use soil in them. In fact, veggies grow well if there is a good part of soil in the potting mix,“ informs Nupur Khaitan, a landscape design consultant. Easily available online, these bags are ideal for balcony or small gardens, where space is precious. “Growing bags are made of polypropylene and some of them are UV treated.Another variety comes with an inner lining of fine dust of coco peat, in which you can directly grow vegetables,“ Nupur adds. But then, if time permits, you can even make your own growing bag. Just add some coco peat or potting mix in a bag that is large enough to grow your plants. Make sure to leave plenty of edging to hold the peat compost mixture in place. HOW TO USE THEM Decide where you want to grow your plants. Place the bags in an area that receives enough sunlight for the vegetables you wish to grow.Keep the bags well-watered. The plastic often heats up the coco peat mix, so keeping the soil moist is very important.Add nutrients occasionally , as plants quickly absorb nutrients that are already in the mix. Adding tea compost is a good idea.Prop up tall plants Tomat with sticks. But be a grow careful not to tear the bags at the bottom. HOW TO PREPARE AND PLANT You must loosen the contents of the bag by shaking it. Shape the bag into a low mound, making sure compost is spread.Pierce the base of the bag for drainage and cut out the premarked planting squares.Scoop out a little peat-compost mix from each square, leaving a hole that is big enough to place the roots. Put one sapling in each hole and refill it with compost around it.The root should remain just below the top surface of the soil. Water well. WHAT TO GROW Shallow-rooted plants grow best in bags. Good choices would be tomatoes, capsicum, brinjals, cucumbers, beans, lettuce, herbs and flowers. Plant 2-3 saplings in each bag. AFTERCARE When top-heavy crops are about 8 inches tall, push a cane into the bag next to each plant.Tie the plant to the cane. This will prevent the plants from toppling over. Keep the compost moist. When flowers appear, feed plants such as plants such as brinjals, tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers with high potash fertiliser. When crops die, split the bag open and recycle the compost as a soil condi tioner. tioner. Bagged potting soil is pasteurised to kill weeds, which makes gar dening easier."

"The BCCI officials may have accepted a cap of nine years on tenure, but the three-year cooling off period between every term in office is what they are contesting in the Supreme Court. Puneet Bali, who represented the BCCI officials in the Supreme Court on Wednesday , said continuity is the bone of contention and that the Lodha reforms should be re-modelled to ensure the office-bearers get an extended term. “The three-year cooling off period could be applicable for the post of BCCI president. But those who are the joint-secretary or treasu rer should be given a chance to become secretary ,“ Bali told TOI, explaining BCCI's point of view. BCCI also has an objection to FAQs of the Lodha Committee, which do not permit an office-bearer who has completed nine years in the state to come into the BCCI only after a three-year cooling off period. “If no one from the state unit is allowed to continue after completing nine years, then the BCCI will be left without experienced officials to run the cricket affairs,“ Bali said. A section in the BCCI said these objections are just a mechanism by Amitabh Choudhary and Anirudh Chaudhary to remain in office. Justice (retired) RM Lodha agreed with this view.“You can't tweak the reforms just to suit a few individuals.These reforms aren't supposed to be changed. If the board officials want to make their own cooling off rules, it will revert back to the same old system of monopoly,“ Lodha told TOI. Lodha said that there is no harm in fresh faces being given a chance to run the game in the country . “As I have said earlier, others should be given an opportunity to come into the BCCI. If the officials are allowed to stay on for nine years on the trot, they will treat the board like their own property ,“ he said."
"The Bhagalpur chief judicial magistrate issued arrest warrants against three people in connection with the multi-crore Srijan fund transfer scam on Wednesday evening.

The accused were identified as Amit and Priya Kumar, the son and daughter-in-law of Srijan Mahila Sahyog Samiti founder Manorama Devi, and Bhagalpur public grievances redressal officer Rajeev Ranjan Singh.

The NGO is accused of working in cahoots with bankers and treasury officials to illegally divert government funds into its own accounts. The scam, estimated at over Rs 700 crore, first came to light when a government cheque presented to a Bhagalpur bank bounced due to insufficient funds on August 3.

Amit and Priya had taken over the reins of the NGO after the demise of Devi in February. Lookout notices have been issued against the duo to ensure they do not leave the country. Singh used to be a land acquisition officer at Bhagalpur.

Investigators have also found a December 2003 letter from the then Bhagalpur district magistrate, instructing senior district officials to deposit government funds into the NGO’s bank accounts. As many as 10 people have come under the scanner in connection with the alleged scam, which the state opposition has compared with Madhya Pradesh’s Vyapam controversy.

The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has been on the offensive in the state assembly for over three days now, raising fears that the five-day monsoon session may come a cropper. It has demanded the resignations of chief minister Nitish Kumar and deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi for their alleged involvement in the scam.

RJD chief Lalu Prasad has even alleged foul play in the death of Mahesh Mandal, a welfare department official accused in the fund transfer scam. Mandal had succumbed to chronic kidney disease on August 20.

The Bhagalpur district magistrate had initially appointed a three-member committee led by deputy development commissioner Amit Kumar to investigate the Srijan scam. The probe revealed that certain fraudsters illegally transferred government funds to the NGO’s accounts by forging the district magistrate’s signature. It also found that the scam has now spread to multiple departments beyond the geographical boundaries of Bhagalpur. The state government transferred Amit Kumar as the district magistrate of Lakhisarai on August 18.

Besides diverting government funds, the NGO is accused of avoiding government audits between 2007 and 2014 by fudging bank passbooks while continuing to earn interest on the principal amount.

Eleven FIRs have been filed and 18 people arrested in the scam until now. The state government has recommended a CBI probe into the matter."
"The BMC panel that probed the July 25 Ghatkopar building crash has concluded that illegal alterations made by local strongman Sunil Shitap, owner of the ground-floor flats, resulted in the tragedy that claimed 17 lives. Shitap, known for his Shiv Sena links, carried out modifications without taking any precautions for the structure's stability, and over-exposure of RCC columns acted as trigger for the collapse, the report has said. It also mentioned that photos published by TOI on July 28 had made the over-exposure of columns evident. The inquiry committee headed by additional civic commissioner Vijay Singhal has made over a dozen recommendations, all of which have been accepted by the civic chief, and suggested disciplinary action against several civic officials for administrative lapses. The BMC panel that probed the July 25 Ghatkopar building crash has blamed local strongman Sunil Shitap for making illegal alterations that resulted in loss of lives and property . The three-member committee submitted its report to civic chief Ajoy Mehta on Wednesday . One of its recommendations is that illegal structural alterations in buildings be considered a cognizable offence. The committee found that while the building itself was not in great health, it would have survived longer if it had not been tampered with indiscriminately . One of the residents informed the panel that just a day before the crash, he had had a meeting with Shitap at the latter's ground-floor premises and had seen that the concrete cover of six columns had been removed and reinforcements exposed. The activity carried on in the premises on the morning of the collapse was `the last straw which broke the camel's back', the committee has said. The panel also recorded the statement of Dr Padma Khade, who had been running a maternity home from Shitap's ground-floor premises from July 2009 up till a month before the tragedy . Khade said that the last delivery in the maternity home was done on June 25, exactly a month before the crash. She told the committee that she had moved her belongings from the premises on July 4 but Shitap had pressurized her to vacate the place even before that by sending in labourers for carrying out work. The committee observed that it seemed Shitap was in a hurry to get work done faster on his proposed `Shitap' hospital, for which he had made two applications to the Medical Officer, Health (MOH), N ward, in his wife's name. The report, in addition, examined other unauthorized works carried out by Shitap--two in Ghatkopar itself, and then at a lounge at Powai--and noted that the accused “has been acting extremely irresponsibly, showing disregard for rules and regulations and other fellow residents' concerns“. “He seems to be indulging in unauthorized construction in N ward, S ward areas and grabbing public land and constructing structures for monetary benefits,“ stated the report. The deputy municipal commissioner (zone-I) and director have been asked to ensure that all recommendations of the committee are implemented in six months."
"The Bombay high court on Wednesday said that it was satisfied with the measures taken by the state government to “maintain law and order“ and declined to issue any directives to prevent attacks by cow vigilantes during Bakri Eid. “We are satisfied that the state has taken necessary steps to ensure peace during festivals,“ said a division bench of Justices Bhushan Gavai and Makrand Karnik, while pointing out that this year the Muslim festival of Bakr Eid coincides with the Hindu festival, Ganesh Chathurthi. The court accepted the state's assurance that no untoward incidents will take place while transporting animals for Eid. The court was hearing a PIL seeking action against “self-proclaimed gau rakshaks“."
"The boss of Australia's foreign intelligence agency has been criticised for clenching his fist in a photo with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte. Mr Duterte used the pose in his 2016 presidential campaign, a symbol of his tough and controversial crime policies. Critics said the photo of Nick Warner, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (Asis) director-general, sent an inappropriate message from Canberra. The Australian government said the photo was not Mr Warner's idea. Mr Duterte has been condemned by human rights groups for his crackdown on drugs in the Philippines, which has seen thousands of people die at the hands of police. The drug war has sparked civil unrest and protests against Mr Duterte's presidency, as well as criticism from community leaders. Photos of the meeting between Mr Duterte and Mr Warner at Manila's Malacanang Palace were shared on the president's Twitter account. Elaine Pearson, the director of Human Rights Watch in Australia, said Mr Warner's gesture was unwise. ""Sickening to see head of Australia's spy agency fist-bumping a man who has instigated the killing of thousands,"" she wrote online . ""You wouldn't pose like this with a mass murderer. And one day, Duterte may be indicted for crimes against humanity."" Australian MP Anthony Byrne said the photo was ""completely inappropriate for the head of one [of] our most important intelligent services to be in"". However Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, whose department oversees Asis, said she was ""confident it would not have been his [Mr Warner's] idea"". ""I do not know the details of how it came about or who released the photograph,"" she said. ""But of course the Australian Secret Intelligence Service is called a secret intelligence service for a reason. Preferably the work that Asis does is below the surface but there are instances where it comes public."" Earlier this week, Ms Bishop told Fairfax Media that Australia was deeply concerned about extra-judicial killings in the Philippines. Media outlets reported a palace official as saying Mr Duterte and Mr Warner had discussed routine matters such as regional security. Last week, the Australian government added so-called Islamic State in East Asia to its official list of terrorist organisations. It follows warnings by Australian intelligence chiefs about security threats in South East Asia."
"The Cabinet has approved setting up of a panel of ministers to oversee the process of consolidation in state-run banks. Finance minister Arun Jaitley said names for the panel would be decided by PM Narendra Modi. “The objective is to create strong banks,“ Jaitley told a news conference and added that decisions for merger would be “purely commercial“. The FM made it clear that the proposal must start from the boards of banks. The proposals from banks for in-principle approval to formulate schemes of amalgamation shall be placed before the Alternative Mechanism (AM), which is the panel of ministers. He said the Cabinet decision is expected to facilitate creation of competitive banks in the public sector space to meet credit ne eds of a growing econo my , absorb shocks and ha ve the capacity to raise re sources without depending unduly on the state exchequer . Asked whether some mergers were possible this year , the FM said he hoped that some would happen but didn't give numbers. “After in-principle approval, the banks will take steps in accordance with law and Sebi's requirements. The final scheme will be notified by the central government in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India,“ said Jaitley . “Our experience of consolidation has been positive,“ the FM said, adding that an Alternative Mechanism would help facilitate quick decisions. A government source said there would be no job loss as a result of mergers. Bank unions ha ve protested against consolidation moves fearing job loss. Last year , five associate banks of SBI and the Bharatiya Mahila Bank were merged with SBI in record time, unlike earlier mergers of State Bank of Indore and Saurashtra. There are 20 PSBs other than SBI. The banking scenario has changed since 1970s and '80s when banks were nationalised, with increased presence from private sector banks, NBFCs, regional rural banks, payment and small finance banks. Successive governments have been pushing the idea of consolidation to create four-to-five strong banks of global scale but now officials are talking about 10-15 banks in the public sector space."
The cabinet has okayed the setting up of a ministers' panel to oversee the process of consolidation in state -run banks. The FM said the move is expected to help create competitive PSU banks to meet the credit needs of a growing economy .

"The calls from Infosys' clients have already begun and sales teams are finding their prospects shying away, adding an increasing urgency to the need to settle the dispute at India's secondlargest IT services company. The trouble at Infosys, which has been brewing since the start of this year, boiled over on Friday when CEO Vishal Sikka resigned and the company's board attacked founder NR Narayana Murthy for causing his exit. Sikka had been spearheading Infosys' change and his sudden departure and the prospect of a long-drawn out battle has spooked its customers. “We've been fielding calls today from concerned current (and potential) clients. ...news will certainly slow down decision-making for prospects that have shortlisted Infosys,“ Stanton Lacy, principal analyst with technology advisory firm ISG, said. Lacy said the calls started coming in as soon as news of Sikka's resignation hit.Even at Infosys, the scale of the impact has begun to hit. “Sales teams can't talk about anything else or sell because this is what comes up,“ an executive with knowledge of the matter said. A second executive said `sales teams have stagnated.' Foreign analysts, who broker deals with clients, say clients remember the last round of management turmoil and a re-run is not encouraging.“If, every four years or so, you have to call clients and tell them you are stable, chances are they are going to start having doubts,“ said a technology analyst, who declined to be identified. The analyst was alluding to the 2013-2014 period when Infosys saw a whole slew of top management exits and founder NR Narayana Murthy returned to steady the company. Infosys did not respond to a request seeking comment for this story. To be sure, other companies have seen senior executives leave in trying circumstances and in those cases the company's board comes to its aid in soothing clients. Infosys does not, currently, have that luxury. “The board is out talking to investors and shareholders. They should be talking to clients. Who is taking care of the business?“ a former senior Infosys executive said.ET had previously reported that Infosys' rivals will be the first in Infosys' rivals will be the first in line to benefit from the turmoil at the company. They have already begun to scent blood. “Existing clients won't walk out immediately but there will be the more than usual quota of questions when they pitch for new clients.The biggest danger is the all this is happening just when digital deals are getting bigger and there is a real threat of losing out there. Infosys stands the risk of losing out a new wave of digital business if matters are not resolved soon,“ a senior executive of a rival company told ET. Infosys has said calling up its customers and calming waters is at the top of its agenda. Sikka outlined the outreach to clients in an investor call on the day his resignation was announced."
"The carniva finally hit town yesterday with Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather Jr. put ting on a bit of a fashion show before promising to knock each other out in their highly anticipated box ing match. Mayweather wore a fe dora and gold rimmed glass es while McGregor sported a three-piece suit and tie and aviator sunglasses as they made separate appear ances before a crowd of sev eral hundred people in front of the arena where they wil fight Saturday night. The two got into an un planned verbal confronta tion as they moved between the outdoor stage and the arena, though it was brief l Bodyguards kept them apart , and both fighters are smart enough not to do anything to jeopardize their immense paydays from what could be the richest fight ever. “It's work,“ Mayweather said when asked if he was having fun. “My job is to be a fighter.“McGregor, meanwhile, reiterated his vow to knock Mayweather out within two rounds, and claimed the boxer was getting desperate in making comments about his weight and stamina.l “Let him keep praying about weight and fatigue.All he's doing is praying,“ McGregor said. “But he's praying to the new god of boxing.“. The crowd for one of the final promotional events was small and not terribly vocal, especially after waiting an hour or two in 100-degree heat to see the fighters.There was no one in line at T-Mobile Arena's three ticket windows, where plenty of expensive tickets remain for the bout. The big money for the two fighters will come from pay-per-view sales, and early indications are that it could break all records.Some 50 million people may watch in the United States alone, with millions more tuning in worldwide. Estimates vary wildly, but Mayweather could pocket $200 million, while McGregor might make $100 million."
